# Future Considerations

## Scalability Path

1. **Current**: Vercel Functions (serverless, auto-scaling)
2. **Phase 2**: Dedicated container (Kubernetes, Docker)
3. **Phase 3**: Microservices architecture with event streams

## Enhanced Features

- **Machine Learning**: Author disambiguation, genre classification
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live enrichment status
- **Advanced Caching**: Multi-layer caching with TTL strategies
- **Analytics**: Detailed metrics on data quality and source reliability
