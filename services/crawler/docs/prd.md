# EzLib Book Crawler Service - Product Requirements Document

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- **Primary**: Automatically enrich book metadata when library staff add books to their collections
- **Secondary**: Provide comprehensive author information and book details to enhance user discovery
- **Tertiary**: Maintain data quality and consistency across the EzLib platform
- **Operational**: Reduce manual data entry burden for library staff by 80%

### Background Context

Library staff currently face significant overhead when adding books to their collections, manually entering title, author, publication details, and cover images. The Book Crawler Service addresses this pain point by automatically enriching book metadata from authoritative external sources.

This service operates as a focused microservice within the EzLib ecosystem, triggered when new books are added and providing background enrichment without impacting user-facing performance. Success is measured by data completeness, accuracy, and reduction in manual data entry time.

10. **FR10:** The system shall maintain referential integrity with existing book and author records
11. **FR11:** The system shall create new author records when authors are not found in the database
12. **FR12:** The system shall link books to authors through the book contributors relationship table

#### API and Service Features
13. **FR13:** The system shall expose REST API endpoints for triggering enrichment jobs
14. **FR14:** The system shall support batch processing for multiple book enrichments
15. **FR15:** The system shall provide health check endpoints for service monitoring
16. **FR16:** The system shall return enrichment job status and progress information

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance Requirements
1. **NFR1:** The system shall complete single book enrichment within 10 seconds under normal conditions
2. **NFR2:** The system shall handle up to 100 concurrent enrichment requests
3. **NFR3:** The system shall cache external API responses for 24 hours to reduce API calls
4. **NFR4:** The system shall implement exponential backoff for failed external API requests

#### Reliability Requirements
5. **NFR5:** The system shall maintain 99.5% uptime during business hours
6. **NFR6:** The system shall gracefully handle external API failures with appropriate fallbacks
7. **NFR7:** The system shall implement rate limiting to respect external API quotas
8. **NFR8:** The system shall retry failed enrichments up to 3 times with increasing delays

#### Security Requirements
9. **NFR9:** The system shall authenticate with the main EzLib API using service-to-service JWT tokens
10. **NFR10:** The system shall securely store external API keys using environment variables
11. **NFR11:** The system shall sanitize all external data before database insertion
12. **NFR12:** The system shall implement IP whitelisting for internal service access

#### Data Quality Requirements
13. **NFR13:** The system shall achieve 95% metadata completeness for books with valid ISBNs
14. **NFR14:** The system shall validate publication dates to ensure they are reasonable (1500-current year)
15. **NFR15:** The system shall normalize author names to prevent duplicate author records
16. **NFR16:** The system shall flag suspicious or incomplete data for manual review

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Enrichment Success Rate**: >95% of books with ISBNs successfully enriched
- **Data Completeness**: >90% of enriched books have title, author, publication date, and cover image
- **Manual Data Entry Reduction**: 80% reduction in time spent by library staff on book metadata entry
- **Service Uptime**: 99.5% availability during library operating hours

### Secondary Metrics
- **External API Response Time**: <3 seconds average response time from external APIs
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >70% of requests served from cache
- **Data Quality Score**: <5% of enriched books require manual correction
- **Cost Efficiency**: External API costs <$0.10 per enriched book

## User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

### Story 1: Automatic Book Enrichment
**As a** library staff member  
**I want** book metadata to be automatically filled when I add a book by ISBN  
**So that** I can quickly add books to our collection without manual data entry

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. When I enter an ISBN-13 in the library management system, book details are populated within 10 seconds
2. Title, author, publication date, publisher, and cover image are automatically filled
3. If enrichment fails, I receive a clear error message and can proceed with manual entry
4. Enrichment works for both new and existing books in our system

### Story 2: Author Information Enhancement
**As a** reader using the social discovery features  
**I want** to see rich author information including biographies and photos  
**So that** I can learn more about authors and discover their other works

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Author pages display biographical information when available
2. Author photos are shown when found in external sources
3. Birth/death dates and nationality are displayed when known
4. Links to author's other works in the EzLib system are provided

### Story 3: Data Quality Assurance
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** to monitor the quality and completeness of enriched book data  
**So that** I can ensure users have access to accurate information

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Enrichment dashboard shows success rates and data completeness metrics
2. Failed enrichments are logged with detailed error information
3. Conflicting data from multiple sources is flagged for review
4. Regular data quality reports are generated automatically

## Technical Integration Points

### Upstream Dependencies
- **Main EzLib API**: Triggers enrichment when books are added to library inventories
- **Supabase Database**: Source of truth for book and author data
- **External APIs**: OpenLibrary, Google Books, Wikipedia for metadata sources

### Downstream Consumers
- **Reader Social App**: Enhanced book discovery with rich metadata
- **Library Management App**: Automated data entry for staff workflows
- **Analytics System**: Data quality metrics and enrichment statistics

### Data Flow
1. Library staff adds book with ISBN in management interface
2. Main API creates book record and triggers crawler enrichment
3. Crawler fetches metadata from external sources
4. Crawler validates, merges, and updates database records
5. Updated book information appears in both staff and reader interfaces

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must operate within external API rate limits (OpenLibrary: 100 req/min, Google Books: 1000 req/day)
- Vercel Functions have 30-second timeout limits for initial deployment
- Supabase database connection limits apply to concurrent operations

### Business Constraints
- External API costs must remain under $500/month for initial deployment
- No user-facing features - service operates in background only
- Must not impact main application performance during enrichment

### Assumptions
- Majority of books added to libraries have valid ISBN-13 identifiers
- External APIs (OpenLibrary, Google Books) maintain stable interfaces
- Library staff prefer automated accuracy over immediate availability
- Internet connectivity is reliable for external API access

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
- Machine learning for author name disambiguation
- Automatic genre classification based on book descriptions
- Integration with additional book databases (Goodreads, WorldCat)
- Real-time enrichment status updates via WebSocket

### Phase 3 Features
- Image processing for cover optimization and variant generation
- Multilingual metadata support for international books
- Book recommendation engine based on enriched metadata
- Analytics dashboard for data source quality comparison
