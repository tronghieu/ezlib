# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- **Primary**: Automatically enrich book metadata when library staff add books to their collections
- **Secondary**: Provide comprehensive author information and book details to enhance user discovery
- **Tertiary**: Maintain data quality and consistency across the EzLib platform
- **Operational**: Reduce manual data entry burden for library staff by 80%

## Background Context

Library staff currently face significant overhead when adding books to their collections, manually entering title, author, publication details, and cover images. The Book Crawler Service addresses this pain point by automatically enriching book metadata from authoritative external sources.

This service operates as a focused microservice within the EzLib ecosystem, triggered when new books are added and providing background enrichment without impacting user-facing performance. Success is measured by data completeness, accuracy, and reduction in manual data entry time.
