# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic FastAPI Structure

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** development team  
**I want** to set up the basic FastAPI project structure with essential dependencies

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Python 3.11+ project is initialized with Poetry dependency management
2. FastAPI application runs successfully with basic health check endpoint
3. Project follows the defined source tree structure from architecture docs
4. Essential dependencies are installed and configured (FastAPI, Pydantic, httpx)
5. Development environment is set up with code quality tools (Black, Ruff, pytest)
6. Docker configuration is in place for containerized deployment

  - [ ] Add uvicorn 0.23+ as ASGI server
- [ ] Task 3: Create Basic FastAPI Application (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Implement basic FastAPI app in src/main.py
  - [ ] Create health check endpoint at /health
  - [ ] Configure async application startup/shutdown

- [ ] Task 4: Set Up Development Tools (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add Black 23.7+ for code formatting
  - [ ] Add Ruff 0.0.285+ for linting
  - [ ] Add pytest 7.4+ and pytest-asyncio 0.21+ for testing
  - [ ] Add mypy 1.5+ for type checking
  - [ ] Configure tool settings in pyproject.toml
- [ ] Task 5: Create Docker Configuration (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Create Dockerfile with python:3.11-slim base image
  - [ ] Create docker-compose.yml for local development
  - [ ] Add .dockerignore file
  - [ ] Test Docker build and container startup
- [ ] Task 6: Add Project Documentation and Scripts
  - [ ] Create README.md with setup instructions
  - [ ] Add .env.example with required environment variables
  - [ ] Create development scripts (setup, test, format)

```

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Python Code Standards]
- **Formatter**: Black with line length of 88 characters
- **Import Sorting**: Ruff with PEP 8 compliant grouping
- **Type Hints**: Required for all function parameters, return types, and class attributes
- **Naming**: snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- **File Structure**: Follow absolute imports from src root

### Development Environment Setup
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Development Tool Configuration]
```bash
# Required commands to be documented:
poetry install                    # Install dependencies
poetry shell                     # Activate virtual environment
poetry run black .               # Code formatting
poetry run ruff check .          # Linting
poetry run pytest               # Run tests
```

### Docker Configuration Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Infrastructure & Deployment]
- **Base Image**: python:3.11-slim for lightweight container
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose 2.20+ for local development
- **Process Management**: Supervisord 4.2+ for multi-process containers

### API Framework Configuration
[Source: docs/architecture_shards/api-specification.md#Internal API Endpoints]
- Health check endpoint must be available at `/health`
- OpenAPI documentation should be auto-generated by FastAPI
- ASGI configuration for async operations
- Basic middleware for request logging and error handling

### Testing Strategy

## Testing
### Test Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Development & Testing]
- Create tests/ directory mirroring src/ structure
- Test main.py FastAPI application startup
- Test health endpoint returns 200 status
- Test basic application configuration
- Use pytest fixtures for FastAPI test client
- All tests must pass before story completion

### Test File Locations
