# Epic 1: Foundation - Book Crawler Service Core Infrastructure

## Epic Overview
**Epic Goal**: Establish the foundational infrastructure for the EzLib Book Crawler Service  
**Epic Duration**: 4 Stories  
**Epic Status**: In Progress (1/4 Complete)

## Epic Description
Build the core infrastructure and primary integration for the EzLib Book Crawler Service, focusing on OpenLibrary API integration as the primary data source. This epic establishes the service foundation, data flow, and quality assurance systems needed for automated book metadata enrichment.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] FastAPI service deployed and operational with health monitoring
- [ ] OpenLibrary API integration with rate limiting and error handling
- [ ] Complete enrichment workflow from ISBN to validated metadata
- [ ] Supabase database integration with referential integrity
- [ ] Data quality scoring and validation system
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%) across all components

## Stories in This Epic

### âœ… Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic FastAPI Structure
**Status**: Done (Quality Gate: PASS - 95/100)  
**Completion Date**: 2025-08-22  
**Summary**: Established FastAPI foundation with Docker containerization, comprehensive testing, and development toolchain.

**Key Achievements**:
- FastAPI application with health endpoints
- Complete Docker containerization
- Test infrastructure with 5/5 tests passing
- Code quality tools (Black, Ruff, MyPy)
- Poetry dependency management

### ðŸ“‹ Story 1.2: OpenLibrary API Integration
**Status**: Approval  
**Planned Start**: Next Development Sprint  
**Summary**: Implement OpenLibrary client with rate limiting, retry logic, and data model integration.

**Key Components**:
- OpenLibrary HTTP client with async support
- ISBN validation and normalization utilities
- Rate limiting (100 req/min) and exponential backoff
- Data models for external API responses
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### ðŸ“‹ Story 1.3: Core Enrichment Service Logic
**Status**: Approval  
**Dependency**: Requires Story 1.2  
**Summary**: Build enrichment orchestration service with data quality validation and workflow management.

**Key Components**:
- Enrichment service orchestration
- Data quality scoring and validation
- Multi-source conflict resolution
- Enrichment status tracking
- Concurrent request handling

### ðŸ“‹ Story 1.4: Database Integration (Supabase)
**Status**: Approval  
**Dependency**: Requires Story 1.3  
**Summary**: Implement Supabase database client with transaction management and referential integrity.

**Key Components**:
- Supabase client with connection pooling
- Book and author record management
- Transaction-based data consistency
- Author deduplication and canonicalization
- Database schema validation

## Epic Metrics and KPIs

### Technical Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: Target >90% across all components
- **API Response Time**: <10 seconds for complete enrichment
- **External API Success Rate**: >95% for valid ISBNs
- **Concurrent Request Capacity**: Handle 100 concurrent enrichments

### Quality Metrics
- **Story Quality Gates**: All stories must pass QA review (>85/100)
- **Test Automation**: 100% of acceptance criteria covered by tests
- **Code Quality**: All code passes Ruff linting and MyPy type checking
- **Documentation Coverage**: All public APIs documented

### Business Metrics
- **Metadata Completeness**: >90% of books have title, author, publication date
- **Data Accuracy**: <5% of enriched books require manual correction
- **Service Uptime**: 99.5% availability during business hours

## Dependencies and Integration Points

### External Dependencies
- **OpenLibrary API**: Primary book metadata source
- **Supabase Database**: EzLib ecosystem data storage
- **Docker Infrastructure**: Containerization and deployment

### Internal Dependencies
- **EzLib Main API**: Future trigger integration for book enrichment
- **Library Management App**: Future consumer of enriched metadata
- **Reader Social App**: Future consumer for book discovery

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **OpenLibrary Rate Limits**: Risk of exceeding API quotas
  - *Mitigation*: Implement client-side rate limiting and caching
- **Database Connection Limits**: Supabase connection exhaustion
  - *Mitigation*: Connection pooling and proper resource cleanup
- **Data Quality Variability**: Inconsistent external API responses
  - *Mitigation*: Multi-source validation and quality scoring

### Schedule Risks
- **API Integration Complexity**: External API changes or downtime
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive error handling and fallback strategies
- **Database Schema Evolution**: Changes to EzLib database structure
  - *Mitigation*: Database migration scripts and version management

## Next Epic Planning

### Epic 2: Advanced Features (Tentative)
- Google Books API fallback integration
- Wikipedia author biographical data
- Batch processing and job queues
- Caching layer with Redis
- Advanced data conflict resolution
