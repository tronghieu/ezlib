## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 1.1-1.3:
- FastAPI foundation with async database operations support
- OpenLibrary API integration providing book metadata
- Core enrichment service orchestrating the workflow
- Data models for external APIs and internal representation

### EzLib Database Schema
[Source: EzLib ecosystem documentation]
Key tables for book metadata:
```sql
-- Books table (main book records)
books (
    id uuid primary key,
    isbn_13 text unique not null,
    title text not null,
    subtitle text,
    publication_date date,
    publisher text,
    page_count integer,
    cover_image_url text,
    description text,
    created_at timestamp,
    updated_at timestamp
)

-- Authors table (author biographical data)
authors (
    id uuid primary key,
    name text not null,
    canonical_name text not null, -- normalized for deduplication
    birth_date date,
    death_date date,
    nationality text,
    biography text,
    photo_url text,
    created_at timestamp,
    updated_at timestamp
)

-- Book-contributor relationships (many-to-many)
book_contributors (
    id uuid primary key,
    book_id uuid references books(id),
    author_id uuid references authors(id),
    contribution_type text not null, -- 'author', 'editor', 'translator'
    contribution_order integer,
    created_at timestamp
)
```

### Supabase Configuration Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Database Integration]
```python
# Environment variables required:
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
SUPABASE_MAX_CONNECTIONS=20
SUPABASE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=30
SUPABASE_COMMAND_TIMEOUT=60
```

### Data Integrity Requirements
[Source: docs/prd.md#FR10-12]
- **Referential Integrity**: Maintain proper foreign key relationships
- **Author Deduplication**: Use canonical name normalization to prevent duplicates
- **ISBN Uniqueness**: Enforce ISBN-13 uniqueness constraints
- **Transaction Atomicity**: All related changes commit together or rollback

### Author Name Canonicalization
[Source: docs/prd.md#NFR15]
- Normalize capitalization (Title Case)
- Handle name variations ("J.K. Rowling" vs "Joanne Rowling")
- Remove special characters and extra whitespace
- Create canonical form for duplicate detection
- Store both original and canonical forms

### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/prd.md#NFR1-3]
- Database operations complete within 5 seconds
- Support concurrent writes for batch operations
- Connection pooling prevents connection exhaustion
- Proper indexing for ISBN and author name lookups

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#Core Functionality]
```python
class DatabaseError(Exception):
    """Base database error"""

class ConnectionError(DatabaseError):
    """Database connection failed"""

class IntegrityError(DatabaseError):
    """Constraint violation"""

class TransactionError(DatabaseError):
    """Transaction rollback required"""
```

### Testing Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Development & Testing]
- Use test database for all automated testing
- Mock Supabase client for unit tests
- Integration tests with real database connections
- Test transaction rollbacks and constraint violations
- Performance tests for concurrent operations
- Data integrity tests for referential constraints

## Testing
### Test Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Development & Testing]
- Comprehensive database service testing in tests/clients/test_supabase_client.py
- Integration tests for complete enrichment-to-database workflow
- Test database transaction rollbacks for error scenarios
- Validate author deduplication and canonicalization logic
- Test concurrent database operations for race conditions
- Performance tests for batch operations and connection pooling

### Test Database Setup
- Use separate Supabase test project or local database
- Reset database state before each test suite
- Create test fixtures with known book and author data
- Test schema migrations and rollbacks
- Validate foreign key constraint enforcement

### Test Scenarios
**Successful Operations**:
- Create new book with new authors
- Update existing book with additional metadata
- Link book to existing authors
- Batch processing of multiple books

**Error Handling**:
- Duplicate ISBN insertion attempts
- Invalid foreign key references
- Connection timeout and retry scenarios
- Transaction rollback on partial failures

**Data Integrity**:
- Author name canonicalization and deduplication
- ISBN normalization and validation
- Publication date validation and normalization
- Cover image URL validation

### Performance Requirements
- Single book persistence completes within 5 seconds
- Batch operations handle 50 books efficiently
- Connection pool manages concurrent requests without exhaustion
- Database queries use proper indexes for performance
