# Story 1.3: Core Enrichment Service Logic

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** development team
**I want** to implement the core enrichment service that orchestrates metadata collection and validation
**So that** we can process book enrichment requests with data quality assurance and conflict resolution

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Enrichment service orchestrates the complete workflow from ISBN input to validated book metadata
2. Service validates and normalizes input data with comprehensive error handling
3. Multiple data sources are merged with conflict resolution rules (OpenLibrary primary, fallbacks handled)
4. Data quality scoring identifies incomplete or suspicious metadata for manual review
5. Enrichment status tracking provides detailed progress and error information
6. Service handles concurrent enrichment requests efficiently with proper resource management

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 1.1-1.2:
- FastAPI foundation with async support established
- OpenLibrary client integration with rate limiting and retry logic
- Data models for external API responses and internal representation
- Test infrastructure with comprehensive coverage patterns

### Business Logic Requirements
[Source: docs/prd.md#Core Enrichment Features]
- **Primary Data Source**: OpenLibrary API provides authoritative book metadata
- **Data Validation**: ISBN normalization, date validation, text sanitization
- **Quality Assurance**: Completeness scoring, conflict detection, suspicious data flagging
- **Performance**: Complete enrichment within 10 seconds, support 100 concurrent requests

### Service Architecture Pattern
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#Services Layer]
```
services/
├── enrichment_service.py      # Main orchestration (this story)
├── external_api_service.py    # Multi-API coordination (this story)
├── validation_service.py      # Data quality validation (this story)
├── cache_service.py           # Caching layer (future story)
├── database_service.py        # Database operations (next story)
└── metrics_service.py         # Performance metrics (this story)
```

### Enrichment Workflow Design
[Source: docs/prd.md#Data Flow]
1. **Input Validation**: Normalize ISBN, validate format
2. **Cache Check**: Look for recent enrichment results
3. **External Data Fetch**: Call OpenLibrary API (with fallbacks in future)
4. **Data Validation**: Quality scoring and suspicious data detection
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Merge data from multiple sources
6. **Result Storage**: Persist enriched metadata to database
7. **Status Update**: Update job status and return results

### Data Quality Requirements
[Source: docs/prd.md#NFR13-16]
- **Completeness Target**: 95% metadata completeness for valid ISBNs
- **Date Validation**: Publication dates between 1500 and current year
- **Text Sanitization**: Remove HTML tags, normalize whitespace, validate encoding
- **Duplicate Detection**: Author name normalization to prevent duplicates

### Configuration Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Configuration Management]
```python
# Additional environment variables:
ENRICHMENT_TIMEOUT=10           # seconds per book
ENRICHMENT_CACHE_TTL=86400     # 24 hours
ENRICHMENT_MAX_CONCURRENT=100   # concurrent requests
ENRICHMENT_MIN_QUALITY_SCORE=60 # minimum acceptable quality
```

### Error Categorization Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#Core Functionality]
```python
class EnrichmentError(Exception):
    """Base enrichment error"""

class ValidationError(EnrichmentError):
    """Input validation failed"""

class DataSourceError(EnrichmentError):
    """External API failure"""

class QualityError(EnrichmentError):
    """Data quality below threshold"""

class ConcurrencyError(EnrichmentError):
    """Resource exhaustion"""
```

### Metrics Collection Requirements
[Source: docs/prd.md#Success Metrics]
- Enrichment success rate (>95% target)
- Average enrichment time (<10 seconds)
- Data completeness percentage
- External API response times
- Cache hit rates
- Concurrent request handling capacity

### Testing Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Development & Testing]
- Mock external API responses for unit tests
- Test enrichment workflow with various ISBN types
- Validate data quality scoring algorithm
- Test concurrent request handling with asyncio
- Integration tests with real but rate-limited API calls
- Performance tests for timeout and throughput requirements

## Testing
### Test Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Development & Testing]
- Comprehensive service layer testing in tests/services/
- Test complete enrichment workflow end-to-end
- Mock external dependencies (OpenLibrary client, database, cache)
- Validate error handling and recovery scenarios
- Test concurrent request processing with async patterns
- Performance testing for timeout compliance

### Test Scenarios
**Successful Enrichment**:
- Valid ISBN-13 with complete OpenLibrary response
- ISBN-10 conversion to ISBN-13 normalization
- Data quality scoring above minimum threshold

**Error Handling**:
- Invalid ISBN format validation
- OpenLibrary API timeout/failure scenarios
- Low data quality score handling
- Concurrent request limit exceeded

**Edge Cases**:
- Books without covers or publication dates
- Authors with multiple name formats
- Very old books (pre-1900) with unusual publication data
- Non-English books with special characters

### Performance Requirements
- Single enrichment completes within 10 seconds
- Service handles 100 concurrent requests
- Memory usage remains stable under load
- Graceful degradation when external APIs are slow
