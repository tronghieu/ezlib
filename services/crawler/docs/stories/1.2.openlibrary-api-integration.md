# Story 1.2: OpenLibrary API Integration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** development team
**I want** to integrate with the OpenLibrary API for primary book metadata retrieval
**So that** we can fetch comprehensive book details using ISBN identifiers

## Acceptance Criteria
1. OpenLibrary client can retrieve book metadata by ISBN-13 with proper error handling
2. Response data is parsed into structured BookMetadata models with validation
3. Client implements rate limiting (100 requests/minute) and retry logic with exponential backoff
4. ISBN validation and normalization (ISBN-10 to ISBN-13 conversion) works correctly
5. Client handles API failures gracefully with appropriate logging and metrics
6. Comprehensive test coverage for both successful responses and error scenarios

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1, we established:
- FastAPI application structure with async support
- Poetry dependency management with httpx for HTTP clients
- Test infrastructure with pytest-asyncio
- Docker containerization and development scripts

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#External API Integration]
- **HTTP Client**: httpx 0.24+ for async requests with timeout and retry support
- **Rate Limiting**: asyncio.Semaphore for request throttling
- **Caching**: In-memory cache for development, Redis for production
- **Validation**: Pydantic 2.0+ for request/response validation
- **Error Handling**: Custom exception hierarchy with structured logging

### OpenLibrary API Specification
[Source: docs/prd.md#FR2]
- **Primary Endpoint**: `GET /api/books?bibkeys=ISBN:{isbn13}&format=json&jscmd=details`
- **Rate Limit**: 100 requests per minute per IP address
- **Response Format**: JSON with nested book details, authors, and publication info
- **Key Fields**: title, authors, publish_date, publishers, covers, isbn_13, isbn_10

### Source Tree Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#External Clients]
```
src/clients/
├── base_client.py             # Abstract base with rate limiting and retry
├── openlibrary_client.py      # OpenLibrary-specific implementation
└── __init__.py
```

### Data Model Structure
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#Data Models]
```
src/models/
├── external/openlibrary_models.py    # Raw API response schemas
├── database/book_metadata.py         # Standardized book representation
├── requests/enrichment_request.py    # API request models
└── responses/enrichment_result.py    # API response models
```

### ISBN Handling Requirements
[Source: docs/prd.md#FR4]
- Validate ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 formats
- Convert ISBN-10 to ISBN-13 for consistency
- Handle ISBN with/without hyphens and spaces
- Validate checksum for both formats

### Configuration Management
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Configuration]
```python
# Environment variables required:
OPENLIBRARY_BASE_URL=https://openlibrary.org
OPENLIBRARY_RATE_LIMIT=100  # requests per minute
OPENLIBRARY_TIMEOUT=10      # seconds
OPENLIBRARY_MAX_RETRIES=3
```

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Error Handling]
- Custom exception hierarchy: `OpenLibraryError`, `RateLimitError`, `ValidationError`
- Structured logging with correlation IDs for request tracking
- Graceful degradation when OpenLibrary is unavailable
- Metrics collection for API success/failure rates

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Development & Testing]
- Mock OpenLibrary responses using httpx_mock
- Test rate limiting with asyncio time manipulation
- Validate ISBN utility functions with edge cases
- Integration tests with real API calls (limited)
- Performance tests for concurrent request handling

## Testing
### Test Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Development & Testing]
- Create comprehensive test suite in tests/clients/test_openlibrary_client.py
- Test successful book retrieval with valid ISBNs
- Test error handling for invalid ISBNs and API failures
- Test rate limiting and retry behavior
- Mock all external API calls for unit tests
- Include integration tests with actual OpenLibrary API (sparingly)

### Test Data Strategy
- Use real ISBN examples: `9780134685991` (Effective Java), `9780596517748` (JavaScript Good Parts)
- Create fixture files with actual OpenLibrary responses
- Test edge cases: books without covers, multiple authors, missing publication dates
- Test ISBN variants: with/without hyphens, ISBN-10 vs ISBN-13

### Performance Testing
- Verify rate limiting doesn't exceed 100 req/min
- Test concurrent request handling with asyncio
- Measure response time and timeout handling
- Validate memory usage with large response payloads
