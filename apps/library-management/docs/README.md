## Introduction

The **Library Management App** is the administrative dashboard for library staff to manage books, members, borrowing operations, and collections within the EzLib platform. This bounded context serves as the operational heart of library administration.

### Bounded Context Definition

- **Domain**: Library Operations and Administration  
- **Users**: Library staff (owners, managers, librarians)
- **Access**: `manage.ezlib.com` (subdomain-based routing)
- **Scope**: Internal library management processes and workflows

## Architecture Overview

The Library Management App operates within the EzLib monorepo architecture as an independent bounded context:

```plaintext
ezlib/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ reader/                 # Reader social app (ezlib.com) 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ library-management/     # This app (manage.ezlib.com)
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ crawler/               # Book metadata enrichment service
â””â”€â”€ supabase/                  # Shared database and auth
```

### Integration Points

- **Database**: Direct Supabase connection with Row Level Security
- **Authentication**: Shared Supabase Auth with role-based access control  
- **Real-time**: Cross-app notifications for borrowing workflows
- **External Services**: Book crawler integration for metadata enrichment

## Key Features & Capabilities

### Core Administrative Functions

1. **ðŸ“š Inventory Management**
   - Add books via ISBN or manual entry with automatic metadata enrichment
   - Track physical book conditions, locations, and multiple copies
   - Bulk operations for new acquisitions and catalog maintenance
   - Integration with Book Crawler service for rich metadata

2. **ðŸ‘¥ Member Management** 
   - Process member registrations and subscription renewals
   - Comprehensive member profiles with borrowing history
   - Role-based access control (active, inactive, banned states)
   - Member communication and notification tools

3. **ðŸ“‹ Transaction Workflow**
   - Real-time borrowing request processing and approvals
   - Physical check-out and return workflows
   - Overdue management and fee calculations
   - Complete audit trail for all transactions

4. **ðŸ“‚ Collection Organization**
   - Create and manage themed book collections  
   - Control public visibility for member discovery
   - Seasonal and featured collection management
   - Performance analytics for collection optimization

5. **ðŸ“Š Analytics & Reporting**
   - Real-time dashboard with operational metrics
   - Borrowing trends and member engagement analytics
   - Collection performance and acquisition insights
   - Exportable reports for stakeholders

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Foundation
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router (SSR optimized for admin workflows)
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode with comprehensive type safety)
- **Database**: Direct Supabase client integration with Row Level Security
- **UI System**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS (professional admin interface)
- **State Management**: React Query (server state) + Zustand (client state)
- **Real-time**: Supabase subscriptions for operational notifications

### Security & Data Access
- **Authentication**: Shared Supabase Auth with admin role verification
- **Authorization**: Row Level Security policies for multi-tenant isolation
- **Data Protection**: Encrypted sensitive member data, audit logging
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions (owner, manager, librarian)

### Performance & Scalability
- **Rendering**: Server-side rendering for SEO and initial load performance
- **Caching**: Query optimization with proper indexing and stale-while-revalidate
- **Real-time**: Selective subscriptions only for critical operational data
- **Pagination**: Virtualized tables for large datasets (books, members, transactions)
