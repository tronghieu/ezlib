# Epic 4: Internationalization & Localization (Post-MVP)

**Epic Goal:** Implement comprehensive multi-language support with automatic location-based language detection, user-configurable country and language preferences, culturally appropriate date/time/number formatting, and full translation infrastructure to serve diverse library communities globally while maintaining consistent user experience across all supported languages.

## Story 4.1: Multi-Language Interface Support

As a **library administrator in a diverse community**,  
I want **the system to display interface content in multiple languages**,  
so that **staff members can work efficiently in their preferred language**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Support for initial languages: English, Vietnamese, Chinese, with architecture for additional languages
2. Complete translation of all UI text, labels, buttons, and system messages
3. Language switcher component accessible from main navigation
4. User preference persistence across sessions and devices
5. Fallback to English for untranslated content with clear indicators
6. Translation key management system for maintaining consistency
7. Support for right-to-left (RTL) languages in future releases
8. Dynamic loading of language packs for optimal performance
9. Integration with existing user profile language preferences from reader app

## Story 4.2: Location-Based Language Detection

As a **new library staff member**,  
I want **the system to automatically detect my preferred language based on location**,  
so that **I see the interface in my likely preferred language from the first interaction**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. IP-based geolocation to determine user's country/region
2. Automatic language selection based on detected location
3. Clear notification showing detected language with option to change
4. Browser language detection as secondary detection method
5. Cookie/localStorage persistence of language choice
6. Override capability for users to manually select different language
7. Language preference synchronization with user account settings
8. Graceful fallback when detection fails or is blocked
9. GDPR-compliant location detection with appropriate notices

## Story 4.3: Cultural Formatting and Localization

As a **library staff member**,  
I want **dates, times, numbers, and currency to display in my region's format**,  
so that **I can work with familiar formatting conventions**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Date formatting based on locale (MM/DD/YYYY vs DD/MM/YYYY vs YYYY-MM-DD)
2. Time format selection (12-hour vs 24-hour) based on regional preferences
3. Number formatting with appropriate decimal and thousand separators
4. Currency display for fines and fees in local format
5. Timezone handling with automatic adjustment for user location
6. Week start day configuration (Sunday vs Monday) based on locale
7. Address format templates for different countries
8. Phone number formatting based on regional standards
9. Cultural color and icon considerations for different regions

## Story 4.4: Translation Management Infrastructure

As a **library system administrator**,  
I want **robust translation management capabilities**,  
so that **we can efficiently maintain and expand language support**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Centralized translation key repository with version control
2. Translation workflow for adding new languages
3. Missing translation detection and reporting
4. Context-aware translations for ambiguous terms
5. Pluralization rules for different languages
6. Variable interpolation in translated strings
7. Translation memory to maintain consistency
8. Export/import functionality for professional translation services
9. A/B testing capability for translation quality improvements
