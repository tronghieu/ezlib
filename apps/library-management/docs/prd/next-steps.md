# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

The PRD is complete and ready for UI/UX specification development. Please create a comprehensive front-end specification using the `front-end-spec-tmpl` template, focusing on the dashboard-centric, search-first interface paradigms outlined in the UI Design Goals section. Pay special attention to the circulation desk workflows and multi-tenant library context switching requirements.

## Architect Prompt

The PRD provides detailed technical assumptions and system requirements. Please create the frontend architecture document using the `front-end-architecture-tmpl` template, ensuring seamless integration with the existing EzLib monorepo structure, Supabase direct connections, and real-time synchronization requirements. Consider the multi-tenant authentication patterns and performance requirements for libraries managing up to 5,000 books and 1,000 members.
