# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable small/medium libraries (1-3 staff, up to 5K books, 1K members) to replace manual/spreadsheet systems with integrated digital operations
- Reduce administrative overhead for library staff by 40-60% through streamlined workflows
- Achieve 99%+ accuracy in book inventory and member data management
- Provide real-time synchronization with public reader interface for seamless patron experience
- Deliver MVP functionality that proves core value before expanding to advanced features
- Establish foundation for multi-tenant SaaS platform serving resource-constrained libraries

## Background Context

The EzLib Library Management System addresses a critical gap in the small library market, where 70% of facilities operate without integrated digital management systems. These libraries, typically serving up to 5,000 books and 1,000 active members with just 1-3 staff members, currently rely on manual processes and spreadsheet-based tracking that creates operational inefficiencies and data fragmentation.

This administrative web application (accessible at manage.ezlib.com) serves as the operational backbone for library staff, integrating with the broader EzLib ecosystem including the public reader interface and book metadata crawler service. By focusing specifically on small library needs rather than enterprise-scale solutions, the system prioritizes simplicity, affordability, and immediate operational value while leveraging modern web technologies and multi-tenant architecture.
