# Story 1.5: Basic Dashboard and Navigation

## Status

**FOUNDATION COMPLETE** - Final Epic 1 story that enables Epic 2 development

## Story

**As a** library administrator,  
**I want** to see a dashboard overview and navigate between different management sections,  
**so that** I have immediate visibility into library operations and can efficiently access different administrative functions.

## Prerequisites

- ✅ **Story 1.2**: Database integration required for dashboard data
- ✅ **Story 1.3**: Authentication required for protected dashboard access
- ✅ **Story 1.4**: Library context required for library-scoped dashboard data

## Acceptance Criteria

### **AC1: Protected Dashboard Layout**
1. Dashboard layout created at `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` with proper route protection
2. Authentication validation ensures only logged-in library staff can access dashboard
3. Library context validation ensures user has selected a valid library
4. Responsive layout optimized for desktop (primary) and tablet (secondary) usage
5. Layout includes header, sidebar navigation, main content area, and footer components

### **AC2: Dashboard Overview Statistics**
1. Main dashboard displays essential library statistics (total books, active members, pending transactions)
2. Statistics properly scoped to selected library context
3. Real-time data updates when library context changes
4. Loading states displayed while statistics are being fetched
5. Error handling for failed data requests with user-friendly messages

### **AC3: Navigation Sidebar Implementation**
1. Sidebar navigation with links to all major sections (Inventory, Members, Circulation, Reports, Settings)
2. Active navigation state highlighting current section
3. Navigation items filtered based on user permissions within selected library
4. Collapsible sidebar for space optimization on smaller screens
5. Quick access shortcuts for common library operations

### **AC4: Header Component with User Context**
1. Application header displays current library name and user information
2. Library selector component integrated in header for easy library switching
3. User profile dropdown with current role display and logout functionality
4. Breadcrumb navigation showing current location within application
5. Global search bar placeholder for future search functionality

### **AC5: Quick Action Shortcuts**
1. Dashboard includes prominent quick action buttons for common tasks
2. Quick actions include "Add Book", "Register Member", "Process Return"
3. Quick actions respect user permissions and library context
4. Quick actions navigate to appropriate forms or workflows
5. Loading and success states for quick action operations

### **AC6: Recent Activity Feed**
1. Dashboard displays recent library activity (recent checkouts, returns, new members)
2. Activity feed scoped to selected library and user permissions
3. Activity items link to relevant detailed views when appropriate
4. Real-time updates when new activities occur in the library
5. Empty state handling when no recent activity available

## Dev Notes

### **Dashboard Design Principles**
- **Information Hierarchy**: Most important information prominently displayed
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex operations accessible but not overwhelming
- **Contextual Actions**: Actions relevant to current library and user role
- **Real-time Feedback**: Live updates for operational awareness
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for diverse staff usage

### **Navigation Architecture**
- **Dashboard-Centric**: Home base for all library operations
- **Search-First**: Global search prominent for quick access to data
- **Role-Adaptive**: Navigation adjusts to user permissions
- **Context-Aware**: All sections understand current library context
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Optimized for tablet usage at circulation desk

### **Performance Considerations**
- Statistics should be cached and updated incrementally
- Real-time subscriptions should be efficient and properly scoped
- Navigation state should be persistent across page refreshes
- Dashboard should handle large datasets gracefully
- Quick actions should provide immediate feedback

### **Integration Requirements**
- Dashboard must integrate seamlessly with Epic 2 book and member management
- Navigation must support future Epic 3 and 4 advanced features
- Activity feed foundation for future comprehensive audit logging
- Search placeholder preparation for future advanced search capabilities
