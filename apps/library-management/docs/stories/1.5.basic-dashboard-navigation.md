Dashboard foundation fully operational with protected authentication, real-time statistics, responsive navigation, library context management, quick actions, and activity feed. Epic 2 development ready to begin.

## Story

**As a** library administrator,  
**I want** to see a dashboard overview and navigate between different management sections,  
**so that** I have immediate visibility into library operations and can efficiently access different administrative functions.

## Prerequisites

2. Statistics properly scoped to selected library context
3. Real-time data updates when library context changes
4. Loading states displayed while statistics are being fetched
5. Error handling for failed data requests with user-friendly messages

## Dev Notes

### **Dashboard Design Principles**

- **Information Hierarchy**: Most important information prominently displayed
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex operations accessible but not overwhelming
- **Contextual Actions**: Actions relevant to current library and user role
- **Real-time Feedback**: Live updates for operational awareness
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for diverse staff usage

### **Navigation Architecture**

- **Dashboard-Centric**: Home base for all library operations
- **Search-First**: Global search prominent for quick access to data
- **Role-Adaptive**: Navigation adjusts to user permissions
- **Context-Aware**: All sections understand current library context
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Optimized for tablet usage at circulation desk

### **Performance Considerations**

- Statistics should be cached and updated incrementally
- Real-time subscriptions should be efficient and properly scoped
- Navigation state should be persistent across page refreshes
- Dashboard should handle large datasets gracefully
- Quick actions should provide immediate feedback

### **Integration Requirements**

- Dashboard must integrate seamlessly with Epic 2 book and member management
- Navigation must support future Epic 3 and 4 advanced features
- Activity feed foundation for future comprehensive audit logging
- Search placeholder preparation for future advanced search capabilities

### **Testing Standards**

- **Test Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library for unit and integration tests
- **E2E Framework**: Playwright for end-to-end testing
- **Test File Location**: Tests should be co-located with components in `__tests__` directories
- **Test File Naming**: `{component}.test.tsx` for unit tests, `{feature}.spec.ts` for E2E tests
- **Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% code coverage for new components
- **Testing Patterns**:
  - Use `describe` blocks to group related tests
  - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
  - Mock Supabase client for unit tests
  - Use data-testid attributes for E2E test selectors
- **Specific Requirements for Story 1.5**:
  - Test authentication middleware blocks unauthenticated access
  - Test library context filtering for all dashboard data
  - Test permission-based navigation filtering
  - Test responsive layout breakpoints (desktop: 1920px, tablet: 768px)
  - Test real-time subscription updates for activity feed
  - Performance test: Dashboard load time < 2 seconds with 5,000 books
