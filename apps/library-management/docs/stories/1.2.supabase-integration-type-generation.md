# Story 1.2: Supabase Integration and Type Generation

## Status

Ready for Review

**CRITICAL - BLOCKS EPIC 2** - Must complete before any Epic 2 development

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to establish secure Supabase connection with generated TypeScript types,  
**so that** the application has type-safe database access and proper integration with the existing EzLib schema.

## Acceptance Criteria

### **AC1: Environment Configuration Setup**

## Epic 2 Dependencies Resolved

### **Enables the Following Epic 2 Stories:**

- ✅ **Story 2.1**: Book list interface can fetch data
- ✅ **Story 2.2**: Add new books can save data
- ✅ **Story 2.4**: Member management can store/retrieve members
- ✅ **Story 2.5**: Checkout operations can update book status
- ✅ **Story 2.6**: Real-time sync with reader app possible

### **Provides Foundation For:**

- Database operations with proper typing
- Real-time synchronization capabilities
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Error handling patterns
- Server-side rendering with authentication

## Dev Notes

### **Critical Success Factors**

1. **Type Safety**: All database operations must be strongly typed
2. **Connection Reliability**: Health check must validate end-to-end connectivity
3. **Security**: RLS policies must be tested and working
4. **Performance**: Database queries must be optimized and efficient
5. **Real-time Ready**: Foundation must support Epic 2 real-time requirements

### **Common Implementation Pitfalls**

- Using wrong Supabase client type (client vs server)
- Missing environment variable configuration
- Incomplete type generation or outdated types
- RLS policies not properly tested
- Real-time subscription memory leaks

### **Testing Strategy**

- Mock Supabase for unit tests
- Use local Supabase for integration tests
- Test failure scenarios (connection lost, invalid credentials)
- Validate type safety with TypeScript compiler
- Performance test with sample data load

### **Testing Standards**

Based on established project testing framework from Story 1.1:

- **Unit Testing**: Jest 30.1.1 + Testing Library for component and utility testing
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright 1.55.0 for cross-browser integration testing
- **Test Location**: `src/**/__tests__/` for unit tests, `tests/e2e/` for E2E tests
- **Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% coverage for all critical functions
- **Test Patterns**: Given-When-Then pattern for test descriptions
- **Naming Convention**: `{feature}-{test-type}.test.ts` format
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock external services (Supabase) for unit tests, real services for E2E
