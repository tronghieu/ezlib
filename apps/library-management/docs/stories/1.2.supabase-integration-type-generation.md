# Story 1.2: Supabase Integration and Type Generation

## Status

**CRITICAL - BLOCKS EPIC 2** - Must complete before any Epic 2 development

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to establish secure Supabase connection with generated TypeScript types,  
**so that** the application has type-safe database access and proper integration with the existing EzLib schema.

## Acceptance Criteria

### **AC1: Environment Configuration Setup**
1. `.env.local` file created with all required Supabase configuration variables
2. `.env.example` template created for team onboarding
3. Environment variables properly prefixed (NEXT_PUBLIC_ for client-side variables)
4. Local development configuration points to Supabase local stack
5. Production configuration template documented for deployment

### **AC2: Supabase Client Configuration**
1. Client-side Supabase client created at `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` with proper TypeScript typing
2. Server-side Supabase client created at `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` for SSR operations
3. Admin client wrapper implemented for elevated database operations
4. Type-safe table helpers implemented for common database operations
5. Connection health check function implemented and tested

### **AC3: TypeScript Type Generation**
1. Database types generated from existing Supabase schema using `supabase gen types`
2. Types saved to `src/lib/types/database.ts` with proper import/export structure
3. Custom composite types created in `src/lib/types/index.ts` for application use
4. Type helpers implemented for common data structures (Library, BookCopy, Member, etc.)
5. Type generation process documented for future schema updates

### **AC4: Database Integration Validation**
1. Health check endpoint `/api/health` returns comprehensive system status
2. Database connectivity test validates connection to shared Supabase instance
3. Environment configuration validation ensures all required variables present
4. Error handling implemented for connection failures with descriptive messages
5. Health check includes timestamp, version, and environment information

### **AC5: Row Level Security Integration**
1. RLS policies tested to ensure proper multi-tenant data isolation
2. Library-scoped queries validated to return only authorized data
3. User authentication context properly passed to database operations
4. Permission validation integrated with database access patterns
5. Cross-library data access prevented and tested

### **AC6: Real-time Subscription Foundation**
1. Real-time subscription framework established for future Epic 2 usage
2. Channel management utilities created for book inventory updates
3. Connection management implemented with proper cleanup
4. Subscription error handling and reconnection logic implemented
5. Real-time integration tested with sample book status updates

## Implementation Tasks

### **Task 1: Environment Configuration Setup** (AC1)
- [ ] Create `.env.local` with local Supabase configuration
- [ ] Create `.env.example` template for team
- [ ] Document environment variable requirements
- [ ] Test environment loading in Next.js application
- [ ] Validate all required variables are accessible

### **Task 2: Create Supabase Client Configurations** (AC2)
- [ ] Implement client-side Supabase client with TypeScript generics
- [ ] Implement server-side client for SSR and API routes
- [ ] Create admin client wrapper for elevated operations
- [ ] Implement type-safe table helper functions
- [ ] Create connection health check utility function

### **Task 3: Generate and Configure TypeScript Types** (AC3)
- [ ] Run `supabase gen types` from database directory
- [ ] Save generated types to proper location
- [ ] Create custom type helpers and composite types
- [ ] Implement application-specific type definitions
- [ ] Test type safety with sample database operations

### **Task 4: Implement Health Check Endpoint** (AC4)
- [ ] Create `/api/health` route handler
- [ ] Implement database connectivity testing
- [ ] Add environment configuration validation
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Test endpoint returns proper HTTP status codes

### **Task 5: Validate Row Level Security** (AC5)
- [ ] Test library data isolation with sample queries
- [ ] Validate user context propagation to database
- [ ] Test unauthorized access prevention
- [ ] Verify cross-library data protection
- [ ] Document RLS integration patterns

### **Task 6: Establish Real-time Foundation** (AC6)
- [ ] Create real-time subscription utilities
- [ ] Implement channel management functions
- [ ] Test subscription connection and cleanup
- [ ] Implement error handling and reconnection
- [ ] Create sample real-time integration test

## Definition of Done

### **Technical Validation**
- [ ] All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns 200 status with proper JSON
- [ ] Database queries execute successfully with proper typing
- [ ] Real-time subscriptions can be established and cleaned up
- [ ] RLS policies prevent unauthorized data access

### **Code Quality**
- [ ] All code follows established coding standards
- [ ] ESLint passes without errors or warnings
- [ ] Prettier formatting applied consistently
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance maintained
- [ ] Error handling implemented for all failure scenarios

### **Testing Requirements**
- [ ] Unit tests written for all utility functions
- [ ] Integration tests for database connectivity
- [ ] Health check endpoint tested with various scenarios
- [ ] Type safety validated with sample operations
- [ ] Real-time subscription lifecycle tested

### **Documentation**
- [ ] Environment setup instructions documented
- [ ] Type generation process documented
- [ ] Database integration patterns documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide created for common issues
- [ ] Code comments added for complex business logic

## Epic 2 Dependencies Resolved

### **Enables the Following Epic 2 Stories:**
- ✅ **Story 2.1**: Book list interface can fetch data
- ✅ **Story 2.2**: Add new books can save data
- ✅ **Story 2.4**: Member management can store/retrieve members
- ✅ **Story 2.5**: Checkout operations can update book status
- ✅ **Story 2.6**: Real-time sync with reader app possible

### **Provides Foundation For:**
- Database operations with proper typing
- Real-time synchronization capabilities
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Error handling patterns
- Server-side rendering with authentication

## Dev Notes

### **Critical Success Factors**
1. **Type Safety**: All database operations must be strongly typed
2. **Connection Reliability**: Health check must validate end-to-end connectivity
3. **Security**: RLS policies must be tested and working
4. **Performance**: Database queries must be optimized and efficient
5. **Real-time Ready**: Foundation must support Epic 2 real-time requirements

### **Common Implementation Pitfalls**
- Using wrong Supabase client type (client vs server)
- Missing environment variable configuration
- Incomplete type generation or outdated types
- RLS policies not properly tested
- Real-time subscription memory leaks

### **Testing Strategy**
- Mock Supabase for unit tests
- Use local Supabase for integration tests
- Test failure scenarios (connection lost, invalid credentials)
- Validate type safety with TypeScript compiler
- Performance test with sample data load
