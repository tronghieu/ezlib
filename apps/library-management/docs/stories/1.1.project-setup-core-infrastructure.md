### TypeScript Configuration Requirements

- **Strict Mode**: Enable all strict TypeScript options for error prevention
- **Path Aliases**: Configure `@/*` to point to `./src/*` for clean imports
- **Module Resolution**: Use "bundler" for Next.js 14 compatibility
- **Target**: ES2022 for modern browser support

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#TypeScript Standards]

### shadcn/ui Integrated Setup Process

The recommended approach uses the official shadcn/ui Next.js installation guide (https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next):

1. **Single Init Command**: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init`
   - Creates Next.js 14 project with App Router
   - Configures TypeScript with strict mode
   - Sets up Tailwind CSS with proper configuration
   - Establishes component directory structure
   - Configures path aliases automatically

2. **Component Installation**: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component-name]`
   - Installs components with all required dependencies
   - Handles Radix UI primitives automatically
   - Sets up proper CSS and utility classes

3. **Additional Dependencies to Install Separately**:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs": "^0.8.7",
    "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.38.4",
    "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.8.4",
    "framer-motion": "^10.16.5",
    "react-hook-form": "^7.48.2",
    "sonner": "^1.2.4",
    "zod": "^3.22.4",
    "zustand": "^4.4.7"
  }
}
```
