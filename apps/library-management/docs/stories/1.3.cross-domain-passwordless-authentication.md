# Story 1.3: Cross-Domain Passwordless Authentication System

## Status

⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLETE** - Basic authentication working, library staff validation incomplete

🟡 **DEVELOPMENT MODE ACTIVE** - Using placeholder data and owner fallbacks (2025-01-11)

**CRITICAL - BLOCKS ALL PROTECTED ROUTES** - Must complete before Epic 1.4, 1.5, and all Epic 2

## Story

**As a** library administrator,  
**I want** to access the library management system using my existing ezlib.com account with passwordless authentication,  
**so that** I can safely manage library operations through a unified authentication strategy while maintaining platform identity.

## Acceptance Criteria

### **AC1: Authentication Middleware Implementation**

1. Next.js middleware created at `middleware.ts` protecting all admin routes
2. Session validation implemented using Supabase Auth helpers
3. Automatic redirection to login for unauthenticated users on protected routes
4. Proper redirect-back functionality after successful authentication
5. Session refresh handling for expired tokens

### **AC2: Login Interface Implementation**

1. Login page created at `src/app/auth/login/page.tsx` with clean, professional UI
2. Email input with proper validation and error handling
3. Passwordless OTP request integration using `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp()`
4. Clear messaging about required registration on main ezlib.com platform and link to registration page
5. Loading states and user feedback during authentication process

### **AC3: Authentication Callback Handling**

1. Auth callback route created at `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts`
2. OTP token exchange implementation with proper error handling
3. Session establishment and user data retrieval
4. Redirect to intended destination after successful authentication
5. Error handling for failed authentication attempts with user-friendly messages

### **AC4: Permission System Integration**

1. Role-based permission system implemented with owner/manager/librarian roles
2. Permission validation functions created for different library operations
3. Library staff access validation integrated with database queries
4. Server-side permission checking for protected API routes
5. Client-side permission hooks for UI state management

### **AC5: Cross-Domain Session Management**

1. Independent session management for manage.ezlib.com domain
2. Session persistence across browser refreshes and navigation
3. Automatic session cleanup on logout with proper redirect
4. Session state synchronization with authentication changes
5. Future cross-domain session sharing architecture prepared

### **AC6: Authentication State Management**

1. Custom React hooks created for authentication state (`useAuth`, `useLibraryAccess`)
2. Authentication context provider for app-wide state management
3. Real-time authentication state updates via Supabase Auth state changes
4. Proper cleanup of authentication listeners and subscriptions
5. Loading and error states properly managed throughout authentication flow

## Epic Dependencies Resolved

### **Enables Epic 1 Continuation:**

- ✅ **Story 1.4**: Library context management requires authenticated users
- ✅ **Story 1.5**: Dashboard requires authentication and user session

### **Enables All Epic 2 Stories:**

- ✅ **Story 2.1-2.6**: All library operations require authenticated staff
- ✅ **Permission-based UI**: Components can show/hide based on user roles
- ✅ **Audit logging**: User context available for all operations

### **Provides Foundation For:**

- Multi-tenant library access control
- Role-based permission enforcement
- User context for database operations
- Cross-domain authentication architecture
- Real-time user state management

## Dev Notes

### **Implementation Priority Sequence**

1. **Middleware First**: Establishes security boundary before other development
2. **Login Flow**: Core authentication mechanism must work end-to-end
3. **Permissions**: Role validation required before building library features
4. **State Management**: Authentication state needed for UI components

### **Critical Integration Points**

- **Supabase Auth**: Must use existing EzLib authentication database
- **Library Staff Table**: Permission validation depends on library_staff records
- **Session Persistence**: Required for professional library staff workflows
- **Error Handling**: Authentication failures must not break user experience

### **Testing Strategy**

- **Unit Tests**: Authentication utilities and permission functions
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end authentication flow testing
- **Security Tests**: Permission bypass and role validation testing
- **User Experience Tests**: Login flow and error scenario testing

### **Common Implementation Risks**

- Authentication state not properly synchronized across components
- Middleware blocking necessary public routes or assets
- Session persistence failing on browser refresh
- Permission checks not enforced on server-side operations
- OTP email delivery issues in development/production

## QA Results

### Requirements Traceability Analysis (2025-08-29)

**Coverage Summary:**

- Total Requirements: 30 (6 ACs × 5 sub-requirements each)
- Fully Covered: 24 (80%)
- Partially Covered: 4 (13%)
- Not Covered: 2 (7%)

**Test Coverage:**

- Unit Tests: 46 passing tests (excellent coverage)
- Integration Tests: Limited (uses mocks/placeholders)
- E2E Tests: None (major gap)
- Performance/Security Tests: None

**Critical Gaps Identified:**

1. **High Risk**: Missing E2E tests for complete authentication flow
2. **Medium Risk**: Database integration uses placeholder data
3. **Medium Risk**: Cross-domain session sharing untested
4. **Low Risk**: Session timeout scenarios need specific tests

**Quality Gate Decision:** CONCERNS - Strong unit test foundation but missing integration validation

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.3-cross-domain-passwordless-authentication-system.yml

## Current Implementation Issues (2025-01-11)

### Development Placeholders Active

**Critical Issues Requiring Resolution:**

1. **`getUserRoleForLibrary()` Fallback (src/lib/auth/server.ts:143-145)**:
   ```typescript
   // Fallback to development placeholder when database is not available
   return "owner"; // Grant full access during development
   ```
   **Impact**: All authenticated users get owner access regardless of actual permissions

2. **`getAuthenticatedUser()` Placeholder Data (src/lib/auth/server.ts:80-88)**:
   ```typescript
   const placeholderStaffData: LibraryStaffData = {
     role: "owner" as LibraryRole, // Temporary - grant full access for development
     // ... other placeholder fields
   };
   ```
   **Impact**: Bypasses library_staff table validation entirely

3. **Missing Middleware Library Validation**:
   - Current middleware only checks user authentication
   - No library-specific permission validation
   - Missing library context enforcement described in AC1

### Database vs Application Mismatch

**Database Layer (Ready):**
- ✅ Comprehensive RLS policies for all tables
- ✅ `get_user_role()`, `get_user_library_ids()` functions implemented
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation working correctly

**Application Layer (Incomplete):**
- ❌ Queries bypass database validation with fallbacks
- ❌ No integration between app auth and database RLS
- ❌ Development mode grants universal owner access

### Required Actions for Production

1. **Remove Development Fallbacks**: Eliminate "owner" defaults in auth functions
2. **Implement Database Integration**: Query actual library_staff table for roles  
3. **Error Handling**: Proper rejection when users lack library access
4. **Middleware Enhancement**: Add library-specific permission validation
5. **Integration Testing**: Verify RLS policies work with real application queries

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days development + testing
**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Must complete before any Epic 2 stories
