# Story 1.3: Cross-Domain Passwordless Authentication System

## Status

**CRITICAL - BLOCKS ALL PROTECTED ROUTES** - Must complete before Epic 1.4, 1.5, and all Epic 2

## Story

**As a** library administrator,  
**I want** to access the library management system using my existing ezlib.com account with passwordless authentication,  
**so that** I can safely manage library operations through a unified authentication strategy while maintaining platform identity.

## Acceptance Criteria

### **AC1: Authentication Middleware Implementation**

1. Next.js middleware created at `src/middleware.ts` protecting all admin routes
2. Session validation implemented using Supabase Auth helpers
3. Automatic redirection to login for unauthenticated users on protected routes
4. Proper redirect-back functionality after successful authentication
5. Session refresh handling for expired tokens

### **AC2: Login Interface Implementation**

1. Login page created at `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` with clean, professional UI
2. Email input with proper validation and error handling
3. Passwordless OTP request integration using `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp()`
4. Clear messaging about required registration on main ezlib.com platform
5. Loading states and user feedback during authentication process

### **AC3: Authentication Callback Handling**

1. Auth callback route created at `src/app/(auth)/auth/callback/route.ts`
2. OTP token exchange implementation with proper error handling
3. Session establishment and user data retrieval
4. Redirect to intended destination after successful authentication
5. Error handling for failed authentication attempts with user-friendly messages

### **AC4: Permission System Integration**

1. Role-based permission system implemented with owner/manager/librarian roles
2. Permission validation functions created for different library operations
3. Library staff access validation integrated with database queries
4. Server-side permission checking for protected API routes
5. Client-side permission hooks for UI state management

### **AC5: Cross-Domain Session Management**

1. Independent session management for manage.ezlib.com domain
2. Session persistence across browser refreshes and navigation
3. Automatic session cleanup on logout with proper redirect
4. Session state synchronization with authentication changes
5. Future cross-domain session sharing architecture prepared

### **AC6: Authentication State Management**

1. Custom React hooks created for authentication state (`useAuth`, `useLibraryAccess`)
2. Authentication context provider for app-wide state management
3. Real-time authentication state updates via Supabase Auth state changes
4. Proper cleanup of authentication listeners and subscriptions
5. Loading and error states properly managed throughout authentication flow

- [ ] Create session persistence mechanisms
- [ ] Implement logout functionality with cleanup
- [ ] Add session state synchronization
- [ ] Test session behavior across browser scenarios
- [ ] Prepare architecture for future cross-domain sessions

### **Task 6: Create Authentication State Management** (AC6)

- [ ] Create authentication context provider
- [ ] Add real-time auth state synchronization
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup and memory management
- [ ] Test authentication state management across components

## Definition of Done

### **Technical Validation**

- [ ] Protected routes properly redirect unauthenticated users to login
- [ ] Login flow successfully sends OTP emails and processes tokens
- [ ] Authentication callback properly establishes user sessions
- [ ] Permission system correctly enforces role-based access control
- [ ] Session management persists across browser refreshes and navigation
- [ ] Authentication state updates propagate properly throughout application

### **Security Requirements**

- [ ] All sensitive routes protected by middleware
- [ ] User sessions properly validated on server-side
- [ ] Permission checks performed at both client and server levels
- [ ] Authentication tokens properly handled and refreshed
- [ ] No authentication bypasses or security vulnerabilities

### **User Experience Validation**

- [ ] Login process intuitive with clear instructions and feedback
- [ ] Error messages helpful and user-friendly
- [ ] Loading states provide appropriate feedback during authentication
- [ ] Successful authentication smoothly redirects to intended destination
- [ ] Logout process clears session and redirects appropriately

### **Code Quality Standards**

- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance maintained
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive for all authentication scenarios
- [ ] Authentication code follows established patterns and conventions
- [ ] Security best practices implemented throughout
- [ ] Performance optimized for authentication operations

## Epic Dependencies Resolved

### **Enables Epic 1 Continuation:**

- ✅ **Story 1.4**: Library context management requires authenticated users
- ✅ **Story 1.5**: Dashboard requires authentication and user session

### **Enables All Epic 2 Stories:**

- ✅ **Story 2.1-2.6**: All library operations require authenticated staff
- ✅ **Permission-based UI**: Components can show/hide based on user roles
- ✅ **Audit logging**: User context available for all operations

### **Provides Foundation For:**

- Multi-tenant library access control
- Role-based permission enforcement
- User context for database operations
- Cross-domain authentication architecture
- Real-time user state management

## Dev Notes

### **Implementation Priority Sequence**

1. **Middleware First**: Establishes security boundary before other development
2. **Login Flow**: Core authentication mechanism must work end-to-end
3. **Permissions**: Role validation required before building library features
4. **State Management**: Authentication state needed for UI components

### **Critical Integration Points**

- **Supabase Auth**: Must use existing EzLib authentication database
- **Library Staff Table**: Permission validation depends on library_staff records
- **Session Persistence**: Required for professional library staff workflows
- **Error Handling**: Authentication failures must not break user experience

### **Testing Strategy**

- **Unit Tests**: Authentication utilities and permission functions
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end authentication flow testing
- **Security Tests**: Permission bypass and role validation testing
- **User Experience Tests**: Login flow and error scenario testing

### **Common Implementation Risks**

- Authentication state not properly synchronized across components
- Middleware blocking necessary public routes or assets
- Session persistence failing on browser refresh
- Permission checks not enforced on server-side operations
- OTP email delivery issues in development/production
