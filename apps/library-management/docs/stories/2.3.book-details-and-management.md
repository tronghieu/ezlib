# Story 2.3: Book Details and Management

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status
Ready for Implementation

## Story

**As a** library staff member,  
**I want** to view detailed book information and edit book records,  
**so that** I can maintain accurate inventory data and make necessary corrections.

## Dev Notes

### **Previous Story Context**

Based on completed Story 2.2 (Ultra-Simple Add New Books), we have:

- Progressive book creation workflow with book search → edition → author → copies creation
- Established book copy creation patterns with library-specific details
- Real-time TanStack Query integration for book data operations
- Library context system with RLS policies for data isolation
- Comprehensive error handling and loading state patterns
- Mobile-responsive design with shadcn/ui components

### Book Creation Reviews
Because edition relation with creation logic and validation, we should to review book copy creation code:
- `src/lib/api/book-copies.ts`: book copies apis functions
- `src/components/add-copies-form.tsx`: add copies form component

### **Data Models and Database Schema**
[Source: docs/architecture/database-design.md, docs/architecture/database-views-and-functions.md]

**Book Copy Management - Detail View Pattern:**

The book copy detail view needs to display information from multiple related tables:

1. **Book Copy Core Data** - `book_copies` table
   - `id` - Primary key UUID
   - `library_id` - References libraries(id) 
   - `book_edition_id` - References book_editions(id)
   - `copy_number` - Library-specific identifier
   - `total_copies` - Total copies of book edition in library
   - `location` - JSONB: shelf, section, call_number
   - `condition_info` - JSONB: condition, notes, acquisition_date, last_maintenance
   - `availability` - JSONB: status, current_borrower_id, due_date
   - `status` - Enum: active, inactive, damaged, lost, maintenance
   - `is_deleted`, `deleted_at`, `deleted_by` - Soft delete fields

2. **Book Edition Information** - `book_editions` table (read-only in this story)
   - `title`, `subtitle`, `isbn_13`, `language`, `country`
   - `edition_metadata` - JSONB: publisher, publication_date, page_count, cover_image_url

3. **Author Information** - via `book_contributors` and `authors` tables
   - Author names and roles for complete book information display

4. **Circulation History** - `borrowing_transactions` table
   - Historical borrowing records for this specific book copy
   - Transaction dates, member information, return status

**Book Copy Update Query Pattern:**

```typescript
// Update book copy with audit trail
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("book_copies")
  .update({
    copy_number: copyNumber,
    location: { shelf, section, call_number },
    condition_info: { 
      condition: conditionValue,
      notes: conditionNotes,
      last_maintenance: new Date().toISOString()
    },
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
  })
  .eq("id", bookCopyId)
  .eq("library_id", libraryId) // RLS enforcement
  .select("*")
  .single();
```

**Circulation History Query Pattern:**

```typescript
// Fetch circulation history for book copy
const { data: history } = await supabase
  .from("borrowing_transactions")
  .select(`
    id,
    transaction_type,
    status,
    transaction_date,
    due_date,
    return_date,
    library_members!inner (
      member_id,
      personal_info
    )
  `)
  .eq("book_copy_id", bookCopyId)
  .eq("library_id", libraryId)
  .order("transaction_date", { ascending: false });
```

### **Component Architecture Patterns**

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Required Tech Stack for Book Detail Management:**

- **React Hook Form 7.62.0** with form state management for edit operations
- **Zod 4.1.3** for book copy field validation schemas  
- **shadcn/ui Dialog** for delete confirmation modals
- **TanStack Query 5.85.5** for data fetching and mutation operations
- **Framer Motion 12.23.12** for smooth transitions between view/edit modes
- **Lucide React 0.542.0** for edit, delete, and condition status icons

**Book Detail Component Architecture:**

```typescript
// src/components/books/book-copy-detail.tsx
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/badge";

interface BookCopyDetailProps {
  bookCopyId: string;
  libraryId: string;
  canEdit: boolean;
}

export function BookCopyDetail({ bookCopyId, libraryId, canEdit }: BookCopyDetailProps) {
  const { data: bookCopy, isLoading } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["book-copy-detail", bookCopyId, libraryId],
    queryFn: () => fetchBookCopyDetail(bookCopyId, libraryId),
  });

  // Detail display with conditional edit interface
}

// src/components/books/edit-book-copy-form.tsx
interface EditBookCopyFormProps {
  bookCopy: BookCopyWithDetails;
  onSave: (data: BookCopyUpdate) => Promise<void>;
  onCancel: () => void;
}

export function EditBookCopyForm({ bookCopy, onSave, onCancel }: EditBookCopyFormProps) {
  const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm<BookCopyUpdateData>({
    resolver: zodResolver(bookCopyUpdateSchema),
    defaultValues: bookCopy,
  });

  // Form implementation with validation
}
```

### **File Locations and Project Structure**

[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

**New Files to Create:**
- `src/app/[library-code]/books/[id]/page.tsx` - Book copy detail page route
- `src/components/books/book-copy-detail.tsx` - Main detail display component
- `src/app/[library-code]/books/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Book copy edit page route
- `src/components/books/edit-book-copy-form.tsx` - Edit form component
- `src/components/books/delete-book-copy-dialog.tsx` - Delete confirmation dialog
- `src/components/books/circulation-history.tsx` - Transaction history display
- `src/components/errors/404.tsx` - 404 not found error block
- `src/components/errors/403.tsx` - 403 forbidden error block

- `src/lib/hooks/use-book-copy-detail.ts` - Data fetching and mutation hooks
- `src/lib/validation/book-copy.ts` - Book copy update validation schemas

**Import Path Pattern (MANDATORY):**

```typescript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Dialog, DialogContent, DialogTrigger } from "@/components/ui/dialog";
import { useBookCopyDetail } from "@/lib/hooks/use-book-copy-detail";
import { usePermissions } from "@/lib/hooks/use-permissions";
import { bookCopyUpdateSchema } from "@/lib/validation/book-copy";
import type { BookCopyWithDetails } from "@/lib/types/books";
```

### **Role-Based Access Control Implementation**
[Source: docs/architecture/data-access-rules.md]

**Access Control Rules for Book Copies:**
- **READ**: Public access for active libraries (catalog browsing) + all library staff
- **EDIT**: Owner, manager, librarian roles for the library (volunteers cannot edit)
- **DELETE**: Owner, manager, librarian roles for the library (soft delete only)

**Use Library Context**
[Source: src/lib/contexts/library-context.ts]
- `canManageBooks()`: check if user can manage books in the library
- `hasMinimumRoleLevel('librarian')`: check if user has librarian role or higher
- `hasRole(['owner', 'manager', 'librarian'])`: check if user has owner, manager, or librarian role for the library


### **Form Validation Schema**

```typescript
// src/lib/validation/book-copy.ts
import { z } from "zod";

export const bookCopyUpdateSchema = z.object({
  total_copies: z
    .number()
    .min(1, "Must add at least 1 copy")
    .max(99, "Cannot add more than 99 copies at once"),
  copy_number: z
    .string()
    .max(50, "Copy number must be less than 50 characters")
    .regex(
      /^[A-Za-z0-9\-_]*$/,
      "Copy number can only contain letters, numbers, hyphens and underscores"
    )
    .optional()
    .or(z.literal("")),
  barcode: z
    .string()
    .max(50, "Barcode must be less than 50 characters")
    .regex(
      /^[A-Za-z0-9\-_]*$/,
      "Barcode can only contain letters, numbers, hyphens and underscores"
    )
    .optional()
    .or(z.literal("")),
  shelf_location: z
    .string()
    .max(50, "Shelf location must be less than 50 characters")
    .optional(),
  section: z
    .string()
    .max(50, "Section must be less than 50 characters")
    .optional(),
  call_number: z
    .string()
    .max(50, "Call number must be less than 50 characters")
    .optional(),
  condition: z.enum(["excellent", "good", "fair", "poor"]),
  notes: z
    .string()
    .max(500, "Notes must be less than 500 characters")
    .optional(),
});

export type BookCopyUpdateData = z.infer<typeof bookCopyUpdateSchema>;
```

### **Library Context and RLS Integration**

[Source: Story 2.2 completion notes, library context patterns]

**Library-Scoped Operations:**

- All book copy operations must include `library_id` filter for RLS compliance
- Use existing library context from URL parameter `[library-code]`
- Permission validation scoped to current library only
- Book copy modifications automatically include library association
- Staff permissions validated through existing authentication system

**Library Context Usage Pattern:**

```typescript
// In book copy detail page component
export default function BookCopyDetailPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: { "library-code": string; id: string };
}) {
  const { library, staff } = useLibraryContext();
  const { canEditBookCopies } = usePermissions();

  const { data: bookCopy } = useBookCopyDetail(params.id, library.id);

  // Component implementation with library-scoped operations
}
```

### **Real-time Integration and Cache Management**

[Source: Story 2.2 patterns - TanStack Query integration]

**Query Invalidation Pattern:**

```typescript
// src/lib/hooks/use-book-copy-detail.ts
export function useBookCopyDetail(bookCopyId: string, libraryId: string) {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  const updateMutation = useMutation({
    mutationFn: (data: BookCopyUpdateData) => updateBookCopy(bookCopyId, data, libraryId),
    onSuccess: () => {
      // Invalidate related queries for immediate UI updates
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["book-copy-detail", bookCopyId] });
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["books", libraryId] });
      
      toast.success("Book copy updated successfully!");
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      toast.error(`Failed to update book copy: ${error.message}`);
    },
  });

  const deleteMutation = useMutation({
    mutationFn: () => softDeleteBookCopy(bookCopyId, libraryId),
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["books", libraryId] });
      toast.success("Book copy deleted successfully!");
    },
  });

  return { updateMutation, deleteMutation };
}
```
