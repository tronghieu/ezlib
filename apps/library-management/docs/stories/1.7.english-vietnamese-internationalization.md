## Dev Notes

### **Previous Story Context**

Based on completed Story 1.3 (Cross-Domain Passwordless Authentication), we have:

- Established authentication system with user sessions
- User profile storage in database
- Authentication context and hooks available for user state management
- Permission system ready for role-based access

### **Technical Architecture**

[Source: docs/i18n-implementation-plan.md]

**Selected Approach**: Cookie-based internationalization without URL routing

- No `/en/` or `/vi/` prefixes in URLs
- Language preference stored in cookies and database
- Uses next-intl v4+ with Next.js 15 App Router
- Full TypeScript integration with generated types

**Project Structure:**

```

### **Key Technical Details**

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Framework Integration:**

- Next.js 15.5.2 with App Router architecture
- TypeScript 5+ with strict mode enabled
- Supabase client integration for user preferences
- shadcn/ui components with translation support

**Component Pattern:**

```typescript
// Standard translation usage pattern
import { useTranslations } from 'next-intl';

function Component() {
  const t = useTranslations('namespace');
  return <h1>{t('title')}</h1>;
}
```

**Database Integration:**
[Source: docs/i18n-implementation-plan.md#database-integration]

Database Schema Addition:

```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles
ADD COLUMN preferred_language VARCHAR(5) DEFAULT 'en';
```

**Performance Considerations:**

- Translation caching with 1-hour cache duration
- Lazy loading for large translation bundles
- Bundle optimization to prevent size bloat
- Server-side rendering compatibility maintained

### **Security Requirements**

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Secure cookie configuration with SameSite protection
- Locale validation to prevent injection attacks
- Input sanitization for all translation parameters
- User preference validation before database storage

### **Error Handling Strategy**

- Graceful fallback to default locale (English) for missing translations
- User-friendly error messages in current locale
- Translation loading failure handling
- Cookie persistence error recovery

### **Integration Points**

**Authentication System:**

- Leverage existing `useAuth` hook for user context
- Use established user profile storage pattern
- Integration with existing permission system

**Component System:**

- Update existing shadcn/ui component usage
- Maintain established styling and design patterns
- Preserve accessibility standards across languages

**Testing**

### **Testing Standards**

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#testing]

**Testing Framework:** Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
**Test File Locations:** `src/__tests__/` for unit tests, `tests/e2e/` for E2E tests
**Coverage Requirements:** Maintain existing coverage standards

**i18n-Specific Tests Required:**

1. **Translation Consistency Tests**: Verify matching keys between en.json and vi.json
2. **Component Integration Tests**: Ensure all components render correctly in both languages
3. **Language Switching Tests**: Validate smooth transitions and state persistence
4. **Form Validation Tests**: Check localized error messages work correctly
5. **Performance Tests**: Verify i18n doesn't impact loading times
6. **E2E Flow Tests**: Complete user flows in both languages

**Test Examples:**

```typescript
// Translation consistency test
describe("Translation consistency", () => {
  it("should have matching keys in all locales", () => {
    const enKeys = getAllKeys(en);
    const viKeys = getAllKeys(vi);
    expect(viKeys).toEqual(enKeys);
  });
});

// Component localization test
describe("LanguageSwitcher", () => {
  it("should switch locale and refresh page", () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### **File Creation Guidelines**

[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

All new files should follow established patterns:

- React components in `src/components/` with proper TypeScript typing
- Utility functions in `src/lib/` with comprehensive error handling
- API routes in `src/app/api/` following Next.js 15 conventions
- Tests co-located with source files or in appropriate test directories

### **Code Quality Standards**

- Maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Follow established ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use existing component patterns and design system
- Implement comprehensive error handling for all i18n operations
- Performance optimization for translation loading and switching
