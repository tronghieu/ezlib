## Dev Notes

### **Previous Story Context**

Based on completed Story 1.7 (English/Vietnamese Internationalization), we have:

- Complete i18n infrastructure with next-intl supporting English and Vietnamese
- Established authentication system with user sessions and library context
- User profile storage and management in database
- Comprehensive shadcn/ui component system with theming support
- Library context system with `/[library-code]` routing structure

### **Data Models and Database Schema**

[Source: src/lib/types/database.ts]

**Primary Tables:**

- **`book_copies`**: Individual book copies with availability status, condition, library scoping
  - Key fields: `id`, `book_edition_id`, `library_id`, `availability`, `condition_info`, `barcode`
  - Relationships: Links to `book_editions` and `libraries` tables
- **`book_editions`**: Specific editions of books with publication details
  - Key fields: `id`, `general_book_id`, `isbn_10`, `isbn_13`, `publisher`, `publication_year`, `edition_metadata`
  - Relationships: Links to `general_books` table
- **`general_books`**: Canonical book information with title and author
  - Key fields: `id`, `canonical_title`, `first_publication_year`, `global_stats`
- **`borrowing_transactions`**: Active and historical borrowing records
  - Key fields: `book_copy_id`, `library_member_id`, `library_id`, `checkout_date`, `return_date`

**Query Pattern for Book List:**

```typescript
const query = supabase
  .from("book_copies")
  .select(
    `
    id,
    availability,
    barcode,
    condition_info,
    book_editions!inner (
      id,
      isbn_10,
      isbn_13,
      publisher,
      publication_year,
      general_books!inner (
        id,
        canonical_title,
        authors!inner (name)
      )
    ),
    borrowing_transactions!left (
      checkout_date,
      return_date
    )
  `
  )
  .eq("library_id", libraryId);
```

### **Component Architecture Patterns**

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Required Tech Stack:**

- **Next.js 15.5.2** with App Router - server and client components
- **React 19.1.0** with concurrent features and Suspense
- **TypeScript 5+** with strict mode (MANDATORY)
- **shadcn/ui** components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS 4** for styling with utility-first approach
- **TanStack Query 5.85.5** for server state management
- **Zustand 5.0.8** for client state management
- **React Hook Form 7.62.0** + **Zod 4.1.3** for form handling

**Component File Structure Pattern:**

```typescript
// src/app/[library-code]/dashboard/books/page.tsx
export default function BooksPage() {
  // Page component with library context
}

// src/components/tables/books-table.tsx
interface BooksTableProps {
  books: BookWithDetails[];
  isLoading: boolean;
  onSearch: (query: string) => void;
}

export function BooksTable(props: BooksTableProps): JSX.Element {
  // Table component implementation
}
```

### **State Management Architecture**

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#state-management-standards]

**TanStack Query Pattern:**

```typescript
// src/lib/hooks/use-books.ts
export function useBooks(libraryId: string) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ["books", libraryId],
    queryFn: () => fetchBooks(libraryId),
    staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, // 5 minutes
  });
}
```

**Real-time Integration:**

```typescript
// Supabase real-time subscription pattern
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = supabase
    .channel("book_changes")
    .on(
      "postgres_changes",
      {
        event: "*",
        schema: "public",
        table: "book_copies",
        filter: `library_id=eq.${libraryId}`,
      },
      () => {
        queryClient.invalidateQueries(["books", libraryId]);
      }
    )
    .subscribe();

  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
}, [libraryId]);
```

### **File Locations and Project Structure**

[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

**New Files to Create:**

- `src/app/[library-code]/dashboard/books/page.tsx` - Main book list page
- `src/components/tables/books-table.tsx` - Book list table component
- `src/components/tables/table-pagination.tsx` - Reusable pagination component
- `src/lib/hooks/use-books.ts` - Book data management hook
- `src/lib/api/books.ts` - Book API utilities and query functions
- `src/lib/validation/books.ts` - Book-related Zod validation schemas
- `src/components/ui/status-badge.tsx` - Status indicator component

**Import Path Pattern (MANDATORY):**

```typescript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { useBooks } from "@/lib/hooks/use-books";
import { BooksTable } from "@/components/books/books-table";
import type { Database } from "@/lib/types/database";
```

### **Authentication and Authorization Integration**

[Source: Story 1.7 completion notes]

**Library Context Pattern:**

- All queries must include `library_id` filter for RLS compliance
- Use existing library context from URL parameter `[library-code]`
- Authentication handled by established Supabase Auth system
- User permissions managed through existing library staff roles

### **Styling and Design Standards**

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui--styling]

**Required Components:**

- **shadcn/ui Table** for data display with proper accessibility
- **Tailwind CSS** utility classes for responsive design
- **Lucide React** icons for consistent iconography
- **Radix UI** primitives for accessibility compliance

**Color Coding Specification:**

- Available books: `text-green-600 bg-green-50` (Tailwind classes)
- Checked-out books: `text-red-600 bg-red-50` (Tailwind classes)
- Mobile-responsive: Tailwind responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`)

### **Performance Optimization Requirements**

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#performance-considerations]

- **Pagination**: Maximum 50 books per page for optimal performance
- **Search Debouncing**: 300ms delay to prevent excessive API calls
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Consider for tables with 1000+ records
- **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js Image component for book covers (future)
- **Bundle Optimization**: Dynamic imports for heavy table components

### **Security and Validation**

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#database-integration-standards]

**Input Validation:**

```typescript
const bookSearchSchema = z.object({
  query: z.string().max(255).optional(),
  sortBy: z.enum(["title", "author"]).optional(),
  sortOrder: z.enum(["asc", "desc"]).optional(),
  page: z.number().min(1).max(100).optional(),
});
```

**RLS Security:**

- All book queries must filter by `library_id`
- User must have valid library staff role
- No direct database access from client components

## Testing

### **Testing Standards**

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Testing Framework:** Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
**Test File Locations:**

- Unit tests: `src/components/tables/__tests__/books-table.test.tsx`
- Integration tests: `src/lib/hooks/__tests__/use-books.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `e2e/book-management.spec.ts`

**Coverage Requirements:** Maintain existing coverage standards for new components

**Required Test Cases:**

1. **Component Rendering Tests**: Verify table renders with mock data correctly
2. **Search Functionality Tests**: Test search input with debouncing and API calls
3. **Pagination Tests**: Validate pagination controls and data loading
4. **Status Display Tests**: Verify color coding for available/checked-out books
5. **Real-time Update Tests**: Test Supabase subscription integration
6. **Error Handling Tests**: Verify graceful error states and user feedback
7. **Mobile Responsiveness Tests**: Validate responsive design on different screens
8. **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation

**Test Examples:**

```typescript
// Component test example
describe("BooksTable", () => {
  it("should display books with correct status colors", () => {
    const mockBooks = [
      { id: '1', title: 'Test Book', availability: { status: 'available' } },
      { id: '2', title: 'Another Book', availability: { status: 'checked_out' } }
    ];
    render(<BooksTable books={mockBooks} />);

    expect(screen.getByText('Test Book')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('available')).toHaveClass('text-green-600');
    expect(screen.getByText('checked_out')).toHaveClass('text-red-600');
  });
});

// Hook test example
describe("useBooks", () => {
  it("should fetch books for given library", async () => {
    const { result, waitFor } = renderHook(() => useBooks('library-123'));

    await waitFor(() => result.current.isSuccess);
    expect(result.current.data).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```
