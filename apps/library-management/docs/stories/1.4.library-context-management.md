# Story 1.4: Library Context Management

## Status

Production Ready

**HIGH PRIORITY - ENABLES MULTI-TENANT OPERATIONS** - Story 1.3 authentication issues resolved (2025-01-13)

## Story

**As a** library administrator,  
**I want** to select which library I'm currently managing,  
**so that** all subsequent operations are scoped to the correct library context and data isolation is maintained.

## Prerequisites

- ✅ **Story 1.2**: Database integration must be complete for library data access
- ✅ **Story 1.3**: Authentication working with proper library staff validation (resolved 2025-01-13)

## Acceptance Criteria

### **AC1: Library Selection Landing Page**

1. Default landing page (`/`) displays all libraries where user has admin permissions
2. Page requires authentication - redirects to login if user not authenticated
3. Each library card shows library name, code, address, and user's role
4. Libraries displayed in a responsive grid layout with hover effects
5. Clicking a library card navigates to that library's dashboard (`/[library-code]/dashboard`)

### **AC2: Library Context Provider Implementation**

1. React Context provider created for managing current library selection
2. Context state includes current library, available libraries, loading states, and errors
3. Context provider wraps entire application to make library context globally available
4. Library selection persistence implemented using localStorage for user convenience
5. Context updates trigger re-renders only for components that consume library context

### **AC3: Library Access Validation**

1. User's library access retrieved from database using authenticated user ID
2. Only libraries where user has admin permissions are shown in selection
3. Library access validation integrated with role-based permission system
4. Library access refreshed when authentication state changes
5. Error handling for users with no library access permissions

### **AC4: Library Selection Interface**

1. Library selector component created with dropdown/combobox interface
2. Selector shows library name, code, and user's role for each accessible library
3. Single library auto-selection when user has access to only one library
4. Search functionality for users with access to many libraries
5. Loading and empty states properly handled in selector interface

### **AC5: Context Persistence and Restoration**

1. Selected library persisted to localStorage with user-specific key
2. Library selection restored on page refresh and app initialization
3. Invalid library selections (removed access) handled gracefully
4. Default library selection logic for new users or cleared storage
5. Context persistence works across browser sessions and tabs

### **AC6: Library-Scoped Data Operations**

1. All database queries automatically filtered by selected library ID
2. Custom hooks created for library-aware data fetching
3. Data operations prevented when no library is selected
4. Library context passed to all relevant components and services
5. Real-time subscriptions scoped to selected library for performance

### **AC7: Multi-Tenant UI Integration**

1. Current library displayed prominently in application header/navigation
2. Library switcher accessible from main navigation for multi-library admins
3. Breadcrumb navigation includes library context throughout application
4. Loading states during library switching handled smoothly
5. UI clearly indicates when operations are scoped to specific library

## Epic Dependencies Resolved

### **Enables Epic 1 Continuation:**

- ✅ **Story 1.5**: Dashboard requires library context for data display

### **Enables All Epic 2 Stories:**

- ✅ **Story 2.1**: Book lists filtered by selected library
- ✅ **Story 2.2**: New books added to selected library
- ✅ **Story 2.4**: Member management scoped to selected library
- ✅ **Story 2.5**: Circulation operations context-aware
- ✅ **Story 2.6**: Search results filtered by library context

### **Provides Foundation For:**

- Multi-tenant data operations
- Library-scoped real-time updates
- Role-based UI behavior
- Audit logging with library context
- Performance-optimized database queries

## Dev Notes

### **Multi-Tenant Architecture Considerations**

- **Data Isolation**: Every database query must include library_id filter
- **Performance**: Library context should not cause excessive re-renders
- **Security**: Library access must be validated on both client and server
- **User Experience**: Context switching should feel instantaneous
- **Scalability**: System should handle users with access to 50+ libraries

### **Integration with Existing Systems**

- **Authentication**: Library access tied to user's authenticated session
- **Database**: Leverages existing library_staff table for access control
- **Real-time**: Subscriptions must be library-scoped for performance
- **Permissions**: Role within library determines available operations

### **Critical Implementation Details**

- **Landing Page Flow**: `/` shows all accessible libraries → Click navigates to `/[library-code]/dashboard`
- **Authentication Required**: Landing page must redirect to login if user not authenticated
- **Library Dashboard URL**: Each library has unique URL pattern `/[library-code]/dashboard`
- **Server-First Architecture**: Uses server-side validation in `[library-code]/layout.tsx` with `validateLibraryAccessByCode()`
- **Hybrid Provider Pattern**: `LibraryProvider` and `LibrariesPromiseProvider` stream server data to client
- Use React Context with Promise pattern for streaming server data
- Implement proper TypeScript typing for library context values
- Handle edge cases: network failures, permission changes, deleted libraries
- Optimize for common case: users typically have access to 1-3 libraries
- Prepare for future enhancement: cross-library operations and reporting

### **Testing Strategy**

- **Unit Tests**: Context provider state management and utility functions
- **Integration Tests**: Library switching with database operations
- **Permission Tests**: Access control and role-based library filtering
- **Performance Tests**: Context provider efficiency with many consumers
- **User Experience Tests**: Library switching workflows and error scenarios
