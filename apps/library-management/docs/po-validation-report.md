**Problem**: No explicit CI/CD pipeline configuration in Epic 1 stories  
**Impact**: Deployment blockers during development execution  
**Resolution**: Created comprehensive **Story 1.6: CI/CD Pipeline Setup**

**Story 1.6 Details:**

- GitHub Actions workflow with quality gates (lint, test, build)
- Vercel deployment with multi-environment strategy
- Health check validation and automatic rollback procedures
- Security scanning and performance monitoring integration
- Complete deployment safety mechanisms

### üî¥ Issue #2: API Documentation Strategy Undefined (RESOLVED)

**Location**: Documentation & Handoff 9.1  
**Problem**: No clear API documentation approach for external integrations  
**Impact**: Integration difficulties with crawler service and real-time events  
**Resolution**: Created **Comprehensive API Documentation Strategy**

**API Documentation Framework:**

- **Layer 1**: Auto-generated Supabase TypeScript types
- **Layer 2**: Crawler service integration contracts
- **Layer 3**: Real-time event type definitions
- **Layer 4**: Health check and monitoring endpoints
- CI/CD integration for automated documentation updates

- **No Feature Creep Detected**: All requirements align with core operational needs
- **Progressive Enhancement Strategy**: Clear separation between MVP and post-MVP features
- **User Journey Completeness**: All critical workflows fully supported

### Core MVP Features Validated

1. **Authentication**: Cross-domain passwordless OTP with reader app integration
2. **Book Management**: Ultra-simple lists with optional ISBN lookup
3. **Member Management**: Basic registration and contact tracking
4. **Circulation**: One-click checkout/return without due date complexity
5. **Real-Time Sync**: Live inventory updates with reader app synchronization
