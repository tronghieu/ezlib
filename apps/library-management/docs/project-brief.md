# Project Brief: EzLib Library Management System

## Executive Summary

EzLib Library Management is an administrative web application that enables small and medium-sized libraries (1-3 staff members, up to 5,000 books, 1,000 active members) to digitize their operations and replace manual/spreadsheet-based tracking systems. The app provides library staff with comprehensive tools for book inventory management, member administration, borrowing operations, and basic analytics - all through an intuitive web interface accessible at manage.ezlib.com.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** 70% of small and medium libraries operate without integrated digital management systems, relying instead on manual processes, spreadsheets, and disparate tools that create operational inefficiencies and data fragmentation.

**Pain Points:**

- Manual book cataloging and inventory tracking leads to data inconsistencies
- Spreadsheet-based member management is error-prone and difficult to scale
- Borrowing operations lack automated overdue tracking and notifications
- Staff spend excessive time on administrative tasks instead of patron services
- No centralized view of library operations or performance metrics
- Difficulty maintaining data accuracy across multiple manual systems

**Impact:** Resource-constrained libraries with 1-3 staff members waste 30-40% of their time on administrative overhead, reducing capacity for patron engagement and library program development.

**Why Now:** The shift to digital library services accelerated by recent events has highlighted the need for operational digitization. Existing library management systems are either too expensive ($2,000-10,000+ annually) or too complex for small libraries to implement and maintain.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept:** A purpose-built, web-based library management system specifically designed for small and medium libraries that prioritizes simplicity, affordability, and operational efficiency.

**Key Differentiators:**

- **Designed for Small Libraries:** Built specifically for 1-3 person teams, not enterprise libraries
- **Simplified Workflows:** Intuitive interfaces that minimize training time and user errors
- **Integrated Operations:** Single platform connecting book management, member operations, and borrowing workflows
- **Real-time Synchronization:** Instant updates across all staff members and integration with public reader interface
- **Multi-tenant SaaS:** Affordable subscription model with built-in data isolation and security

**Success Approach:** Focus on core operational workflows that deliver immediate value while maintaining the flexibility to grow with library needs. Integration with existing EzLib ecosystem provides seamless connection between library operations and patron services.

- **Timeline:** MVP delivery targeted within 12-16 weeks with single full-stack developer, assuming part-time development schedule
- **Resources:** Single full-stack developer with UX support, leveraging existing design system and shared EzLib components
- **Technical:** Must integrate seamlessly with existing Supabase database schema and crawler service architecture

### Key Assumptions

- Library staff have basic computer literacy and internet access during work hours
- Libraries are willing to transition from manual systems with proper onboarding support
- Libraries can provide internet connectivity for staff to use web-based system during operating hours
- Existing EzLib database schema can accommodate library management requirements without major structural changes
- Small libraries prioritize operational efficiency over advanced feature sets
- Real-time synchronization between library management and reader app will enhance rather than complicate library operations
- Community libraries have authority to choose their own management systems without complex procurement processes
- Privacy-conscious approach will differentiate from commercial library management platforms
- Reader adoption will grow organically through participating libraries showcasing book availability

## Authentication & Registration Strategy

### Registration Flow (Reader App Only)

**Single Registration Point:** All user registration occurs exclusively on the Reader app (`ezlib.com`) to avoid user confusion and establish clear platform identity. Library staff must first register as readers before gaining access to management tools.

**Passwordless Email OTP Process:**

1. **Email Collection**: Library staff visit `ezlib.com` → enter email address → request verification code
2. **OTP Verification**: 6-digit code sent to email → user enters code for authentication
3. **Profile Setup**: User completes profile with display name, gender, language preference, and region selection
4. **Default Access**: All accounts created as readers with Supabase authenticated role

### Cross-Domain Access Strategy

**Early Stage Implementation:**

- **Independent Login**: Library staff must log in separately on `ezlib.com` and `manage.ezlib.com`
- **Registration Restriction**: Management app shows "Login with existing account" - no registration option
- **Clear Messaging**: Management app explains users must first register on main platform

**Role-Based Access Control:**

- **Default Role**: All users can access reader features (social book discovery) with authenticated role
- **Library Management Access**: Users gain admin capabilities when added to LibAdmin table for specific libraries
- **Permission Levels**: Owner, Manager, Librarian roles with granular permissions for each library

**Future Enhancement:** Planned implementation of cross-domain session sharing for seamless user experience between applications.

### Technical Implementation

**Supabase Authentication:**

- Email OTP authentication using `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp()`
- JWT tokens with role-based claims
- Row Level Security policies enforcing multi-tenant access

**User Profile Structure:**

- Base user record in `users` table
- Optional `lib_readers` records for library memberships
- Optional `lib_admins` records for management access
- Preference storage for language, region, notification settings

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **User Adoption:** Library staff may resist changing from familiar manual processes to digital workflows
- **Authentication Flow:** Two-step login process (register on reader app, then access management) may create user friction
- **Data Migration:** Complex migration from diverse existing systems (spreadsheets, basic software) could delay onboarding
- **Feature Complexity:** Balancing simplicity with comprehensive functionality may be challenging for diverse library needs
- **Integration Dependencies:** Reliance on crawler service and shared database could create system vulnerabilities

### Open Questions

- What specific library workflows vary most significantly between different small libraries?
- How do current manual systems handle edge cases that digital systems need to accommodate?
- What level of customization do libraries expect for policies, workflows, and reporting?
- How do libraries currently handle inter-library loans and resource sharing?
- Will library staff accept the requirement to register on the reader platform first?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- **Workflow Analysis:** Detailed observation of existing library operations to identify optimization opportunities
- **Competitive Landscape:** Analysis of existing solutions that small libraries have tried and why they failed
- **Regulatory Requirements:** Understanding of any compliance or reporting requirements specific to library operations
