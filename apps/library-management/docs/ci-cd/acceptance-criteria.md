# Acceptance Criteria

## üîß GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration

1. **GitHub Actions workflow file** (`.github/workflows/library-management.yml`) created with:
   - Trigger on push to `main` branch and pull requests targeting `main`
   - Node.js 18+ environment setup with PNPM caching
   - Monorepo-aware build targeting `apps/library-management` only

2. **Quality gates pipeline** includes sequential stages:
   - **Lint**: ESLint validation with zero warnings allowed for production
   - **Type Check**: TypeScript strict mode validation
   - **Test**: Unit tests with minimum 80% coverage threshold
   - **Build**: Next.js production build validation

3. **Environment variable management** with proper secrets handling:
   - Development environment variables from GitHub repository secrets
   - Production environment variables from Vercel environment settings
   - Supabase keys properly secured and injected at build time

## üöÄ Vercel Deployment Configuration

4. **Vercel project setup** with proper monorepo configuration:
   - Build command: `cd apps/library-management && pnpm run build`
   - Output directory: `apps/library-management/.next`
   - Install command: `pnpm install`
   - Framework preset: Next.js

5. **Environment management strategy**:
   - **Development**: `dev.manage.ezlib.com` (preview deployments from PRs)
   - **Staging**: `staging.manage.ezlib.com` (main branch deployments)
   - **Production**: `manage.ezlib.com` (manual promotion from staging)

6. **Custom domains configured** with SSL certificates:
   - Primary domain: `manage.ezlib.com`
   - Staging domain: `staging.manage.ezlib.com`
   - Development previews: Auto-generated Vercel URLs

## üõ°Ô∏è Deployment Safety & Validation

7. **Health check integration** in deployment pipeline:
   - Post-deployment health check hits `/api/health` endpoint
   - Validates database connectivity and essential service availability
   - Automatic rollback triggers if health checks fail

8. **Branch protection rules** configured on GitHub:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging to `main`
   - Require status checks to pass (lint, test, build)
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Restrict direct pushes to `main` branch

9. **Deployment notifications** configured:
   - Slack/email notifications for deployment success/failure
   - GitHub deployment status updates
   - Vercel deployment comments on pull requests

## üìä Monitoring & Rollback Strategy

10. **Deployment monitoring setup**:
    - Vercel Analytics enabled for performance monitoring
    - Basic error tracking configured for production issues
    - Deployment logs accessible through Vercel dashboard

11. **Rollback procedures documented and tested**:
    - Vercel instant rollback capability to previous deployment
    - Database migration rollback procedures for schema changes
    - Emergency contact procedures for deployment issues

12. **Performance baselines established**:
    - Lighthouse CI integration for performance regression detection
    - Build time monitoring and optimization alerts
    - Bundle size tracking to prevent bloat

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Infrastructure

13. **Supabase environment alignment**:
    - Development environment connects to local Supabase instance
    - Staging environment connects to dedicated Supabase project
    - Production environment connects to production Supabase instance

14. **Monorepo integration validation**:
    - Turbo build cache properly configured for CI environment
    - Only library management app builds triggered by relevant file changes
    - Shared dependencies from monorepo root properly resolved

15. **Security scanning integration**:
    - Dependency vulnerability scanning with automated updates
    - Secret scanning to prevent credential commits
    - HTTPS enforcement and security headers validation
