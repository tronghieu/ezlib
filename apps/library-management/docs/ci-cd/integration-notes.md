# Integration Notes

## Sequence Dependency Rationale

- **After Story 1.1**: Requires Next.js project structure and basic configuration
- **After Story 1.2**: Needs Supabase integration for health check validation
- **Before Story 1.3**: Authentication testing requires deployment pipeline
- **Before Story 1.4**: Library context switching needs environment validation

## Monorepo Considerations

- Pipeline only triggers on changes to `apps/library-management/**` paths
- Uses PNPM workspace features for efficient dependency management
- Turbo build caching optimizes CI/CD performance
- Shared configurations from monorepo root properly resolved

## Security Measures

- All secrets managed through GitHub Secrets and Vercel environment variables
- Dependency scanning prevents vulnerable package deployment
- HTTPS enforcement with security headers configured
- Branch protection prevents direct production deployments
