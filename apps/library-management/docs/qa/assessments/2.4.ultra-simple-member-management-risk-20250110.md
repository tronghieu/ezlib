## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. DATA-001: Member ID Generation Race Condition

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Concurrent registrations are common during peak hours
**Impact**: High - Duplicate member IDs would break system integrity
**Mitigation**:
- Implement database sequence or UUID for member ID generation
- Add unique constraint on (library_id, member_id) combination
- Use database transaction with SELECT FOR UPDATE pattern
**Testing Focus**: Concurrent registration stress testing, race condition simulation

### 2. SEC-001: PII Data Exposure Through JSONB Queries

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High - JSONB fields are directly queried without sanitization
**Impact**: High - Personal information leak could cause regulatory violations
**Mitigation**:
- Implement parameterized queries for all JSONB operations
- Add input sanitization layer before JSONB field access
- Enable query logging and monitoring for suspicious patterns
**Testing Focus**: SQL injection testing on search fields, JSONB traversal attacks

## High-Priority Risks

### 3. PERF-001: Unindexed JSONB Search Queries

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Search is core functionality used frequently
**Impact**: Medium - Performance degradation with 1000+ members
**Mitigation**:
- Create GIN indexes on frequently searched JSONB paths

**Testing Focus**: Load testing with 1000+ member datasets

### 4. SEC-002: Weak Invitation Token Generation

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Token generation uses simple UUID without salt
**Impact**: High - Token guessing could allow unauthorized access
**Mitigation**:
- Use cryptographically secure random token generation
- Add rate limiting on invitation endpoints
- Implement token rotation after first use
**Testing Focus**: Token entropy analysis, brute force resistance testing

### 5. DATA-002: Cross-Library Email Duplication

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Same patron might join multiple libraries
**Impact**: High - Data inconsistency and privacy concerns
**Mitigation**:
- Implement global email uniqueness check option
- Add cross-library member linking capability
- Document email duplication policy clearly
**Testing Focus**: Multi-library registration scenarios

### 6. BUS-001: Missing Audit Trail for Compliance

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Regulatory audits are periodic
**Impact**: High - GDPR/privacy regulation violations
**Mitigation**:
- Implement audit logging for all member data changes
- Add data retention policy configuration
- Create audit report generation capability
**Testing Focus**: Audit trail completeness verification

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Concurrent Registration Testing**: Simulate 100+ simultaneous member registrations
- **SQL Injection Testing**: Test all search fields with JSONB traversal payloads
- **Race Condition Testing**: Use JMeter for member ID collision detection
- **Data Integrity Testing**: Verify unique constraints and RLS policies

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Performance Testing**: Load test with 1,500 member dataset
- **Security Testing**: Token predictability analysis with Burp Suite
- **Cross-Library Testing**: Multi-tenant isolation verification
- **Compliance Testing**: GDPR data handling verification

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Cache Invalidation Testing**: TanStack Query optimization
- **Soft Delete Testing**: Data recovery prevention
- **Rate Limiting Testing**: Registration spam prevention
- **Monitoring Testing**: Alert and dashboard functionality

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- DATA-001: Member ID generation race condition (Critical)
- SEC-001: PII exposure through JSONB queries (Critical)
- SEC-002: Weak invitation token generation (High - Security)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- PERF-001: With temporary query result limits
- DATA-002: With documented policy on email duplication
- BUS-001: With manual audit log extraction capability

### Accepted Risks
- BUS-002: Member export (defer to Epic 3)
- OPS-002: Monitoring dashboards (post-launch addition)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Performance Metrics**: Query response times > 500ms
- **Security Alerts**: Failed authentication attempts > 5/minute
- **Data Integrity**: Duplicate member ID detection
- **Error Rates**: Registration failure rate > 1%
- **Business KPIs**: Member registration velocity

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Member count exceeds 500 per library
- Adding payment processing for membership fees
- Implementing member communication features
- Regulatory compliance requirements change
- Performance degradation reported by users

2. Implement audit logging framework
3. Set up performance monitoring dashboards
4. Document data retention policies

### Long-term Enhancements
1. Implement member export functionality
2. Add cross-library member linking
