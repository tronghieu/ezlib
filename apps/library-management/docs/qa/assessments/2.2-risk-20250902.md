## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

**No critical risks identified** - All risks are at medium or lower severity levels with clear mitigation strategies.

## High-Risk Items (Score: 6)

### 1. DATA-002: Orphaned Record Creation

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Multi-step creation process increases likelihood of partial failures  
**Impact**: High (3) - Orphaned records compromise data integrity and create operational issues  

**Risk Details**:
- Complex 5-step creation flow: Authors → General Books → Book Editions → Book Contributors → Book Copies
- Failure at any step could leave incomplete records
- Cleanup of orphaned data requires manual intervention

**Mitigation**:
- **Immediate**: Wrap entire creation flow in Supabase database transaction
- **Implementation**: Use `supabase.rpc()` for atomic multi-table operations
- **Monitoring**: Add transaction failure logging and alerting
- **Testing Focus**: Failure injection at each creation step, rollback verification

### 2. TECH-001: Complex Database Transaction Chain

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex multi-table relationships increase implementation complexity  
**Impact**: High (3) - Transaction failures block core functionality  

**Risk Details**:
- Five separate database operations must succeed atomically
- Error handling complexity across multiple async operations
- Potential for race conditions with concurrent book creation

**Mitigation**:
- **Architecture**: Implement transaction wrapper with proper error handling
- **Implementation**: Use database-level transactions instead of application-level coordination
- **Fallback**: Add cleanup procedures for partial failures
- **Testing Focus**: Concurrent creation scenarios, transaction rollback testing

## Medium-Risk Items (Score: 4)

### 3. PERF-001: Duplicate Detection Query Performance

**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex nested joins may perform poorly at scale  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Slow form submission affects user experience  

**Risk Details**:
- Complex query joining 4 tables for duplicate detection
- Performance degradation with large book collections (5,000+ books)
- User experience impact during form submission

**Mitigation**:
- **Immediate**: Add database indexes on `title` and `canonical_name` fields
- **Optimization**: Consider materialized views for common queries
- **Monitoring**: Track query performance metrics
- **Testing Focus**: Load testing with realistic data volumes

### 4. DATA-001: Duplicate Detection False Positives

**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Title/author matching may be imprecise  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - User frustration with legitimate books blocked  

**Risk Details**:
- Similar titles or author names may trigger false duplicate detection
- Edge cases with abbreviated names, series books, different editions
- User workflow interruption requires manual override

**Mitigation**:
- **UX Enhancement**: Show "Similar books found" preview before blocking
- **Override**: Add staff override capability for legitimate duplicates
- **Algorithm**: Improve fuzzy matching with confidence scores
- **Testing Focus**: Edge cases with similar titles/authors, series books

## Low-Risk Items (Score: 2-3)

### 5. TECH-002: Author Normalization Consistency

**Score: 3 (Low)**  
**Probability**: Low (1) - Normalization algorithm can be standardized  
**Impact**: High (3) - Inconsistent author data affects search and relationships  

**Mitigation**: Implement consistent `normalize_author_name()` function using database function

### 6. TECH-003: External Service Dependency  

**Score: 2 (Low)**  
**Probability**: Low (1) - Optional integration with graceful fallback  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Reduced metadata quality when service unavailable  

**Mitigation**: Circuit breaker pattern with clear user messaging when service unavailable

### 7. SEC-001: Input Validation Bypass

**Score: 2 (Low)**  
**Probability**: Low (1) - Zod validation provides strong protection  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Potential data corruption or injection  

**Mitigation**: Comprehensive Zod schema validation with sanitization

### 8. OPS-001: Real-time Cache Invalidation

**Score: 1 (Minimal)**  
**Probability**: Low (1) - TanStack Query provides reliable cache management  
**Impact**: Low (1) - Minor UX issue requiring page refresh  

**Mitigation**: Retry mechanism and manual refresh option

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- **Technical**: 3 risks (1 high, 2 low)
- **Data**: 2 risks (1 high, 1 medium)  
- **Performance**: 1 risk (1 medium)
- **Security**: 1 risk (1 low)

- Author name variations ("J.K. Rowling" vs "Joanne Rowling")
- Series books with similar titles
- Different editions of same book

### Priority 3: Standard Functional Tests

**Form Validation**:
- Required field validation (title, author)
- Optional field handling (publisher, ISBN, year)
- Character limit enforcement
- ISBN format validation

**Integration Testing**:
- Library context scoping
- Real-time book list updates
