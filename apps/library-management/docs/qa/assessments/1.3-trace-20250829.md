### Critical Gaps

1. **Cross-Domain Session Testing**
   - Gap: No tests for cross-domain session sharing architecture
   - Risk: Medium - Future functionality may not work as expected
   - Action: Add integration tests for cross-domain scenarios when implemented

2. **E2E Authentication Flow**
   - Gap: No end-to-end tests covering complete user journey
   - Risk: High - Integration issues may not be caught
   - Action: Add Playwright E2E tests for login → callback → dashboard flow

3. **Database Integration Testing**
   - Gap: Permission system uses placeholder data, no real database integration tests
   - Risk: Medium - Database queries may fail in production
   - Action: Add integration tests with test database

4. **Session Timeout Testing**
   - Gap: Session timeout behavior not specifically tested
   - Risk: Low - Logic exists but timeout scenarios untested
   - Action: Add tests for session expiration and refresh

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Add E2E Test Suite**
   - Complete authentication flow testing
   - Cross-browser session persistence
   - Permission-based UI behavior validation

2. **Integration Test Enhancement**
   - Database integration tests for permission queries
   - Real Supabase integration tests (with test environment)
   - Session management across multiple tabs/windows

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Session management performance with large permission sets
   - Middleware performance under load
   - Authentication callback response times

4. **Security Testing**
   - CSRF protection validation
   - Session fixation prevention
   - Permission bypass attempts

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Missing E2E tests for critical authentication flow
- **Medium Risk**: Database integration gaps, cross-domain session preparation
- **Low Risk**: Minor session timeout testing gaps

### Quality Indicators Met

✅ Every AC has at least one test  
✅ Critical paths have multiple test levels  
✅ Edge cases are explicitly covered in permission system  
✅ Clear unit test coverage for business logic  
⚠️ NFRs need performance/security test coverage

### Test Coverage by Category

- **Unit Tests**: 46 tests passing (excellent coverage)
- **Integration Tests**: Limited (uses mocks/placeholders)
- **E2E Tests**: None (major gap)
- **Performance Tests**: None
- **Security Tests**: None (beyond basic permission logic)
