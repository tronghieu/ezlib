### Critical Gaps

1. **No Test Coverage**
   - Gap: Zero automated tests for any library context functionality
   - Risk: HIGH - Critical multi-tenant foundation without tests
   - Action: Implement comprehensive test suite immediately

2. **Security Testing Missing**
   - Gap: No tests for cross-library data isolation
   - Risk: CRITICAL - Could expose data across tenants
   - Action: Add security-focused integration tests

3. **Performance Testing Absent**
   - Gap: No tests for context provider efficiency
   - Risk: MEDIUM - Could cause performance issues with many consumers
   - Action: Add performance benchmarks

4. **Error Handling Untested**
   - Gap: Error scenarios not validated
   - Risk: HIGH - Users could get stuck states
   - Action: Add error scenario tests

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend immediate implementation of:

1. **Unit Tests Required:**
   - Library context provider state management
   - localStorage persistence functions
   - Library access validation logic
   - Data operation hooks

2. **Integration Tests Required:**
   - Library switching flow
   - Authentication integration
   - Database query scoping
   - Multi-library scenarios

3. **E2E Tests Required:**
   - Complete library selection flow
   - Library switching user journey
   - Permission-based access control
   - Session persistence

4. **Security Tests Required:**
   - Cross-tenant data isolation
   - Permission boundary testing
   - Invalid access attempts

### Risk Assessment

- **CRITICAL RISK**: No test coverage for multi-tenant foundation
- **HIGH RISK**: Security isolation untested
- **HIGH RISK**: Core functionality without validation
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Performance characteristics unknown

### Recommendations

1. **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: Create test suite before production
2. **P0 Tests**: Library selection, context switching, data isolation
3. **P1 Tests**: UI components, error scenarios, performance
4. **P2 Tests**: Edge cases, concurrent operations
