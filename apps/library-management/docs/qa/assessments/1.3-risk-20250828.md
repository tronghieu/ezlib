## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Cross-domain session sync failure

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Cross-domain authentication is inherently complex, especially when managing sessions between ezlib.com and manage.ezlib.com
**Impact**: High - Complete system inaccessibility for all library staff, blocking all operations
**Mitigation**:
- Implement robust session validation with automatic retry mechanisms
- Use shared Supabase Auth instance with proper CORS configuration
- Add comprehensive error handling for session establishment failures
- Create real-time monitoring alerts for session synchronization issues
- Implement fallback authentication flow if primary fails

**Testing Focus**: 
- End-to-end cross-domain authentication testing
- Session persistence across domain boundaries
- Failure recovery scenarios
- Browser compatibility testing

## High-Priority Risks

### 2. SEC-001: OTP interception/replay attacks

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - OTP sent via email can be intercepted if email is compromised
**Impact**: High - Unauthorized access to library management system
**Mitigation**:
- Implement strict OTP expiration (5 minutes maximum)
- Use rate limiting on OTP request endpoints
- Add brute force protection with account lockout
- Log and alert on suspicious authentication patterns

### 3. SEC-002: Session hijacking across domains

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Cross-domain sessions increase attack surface
**Impact**: High - Attacker could gain unauthorized library admin access
**Mitigation**:
- Implement secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies
- Use HTTPS everywhere with HSTS headers
- Implement session fingerprinting
- Add re-authentication for sensitive operations

### 4. BUS-002: Library staff unable to access system

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Dependencies on email delivery and external auth service
**Impact**: High - Complete operational disruption for libraries
**Mitigation**:
- Implement backup authentication method
- Create admin override capability for emergencies
- Monitor authentication success rates with alerts
- Provide clear error messages with support contact

### 5. OPS-001: Email service provider outage

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Third-party service dependencies
**Impact**: High - No new logins possible during outage
**Mitigation**:
- Implement email provider failover
- Extended session duration to reduce re-authentication needs
- Consider backup OTP delivery methods (future enhancement)
- Monitor email delivery rates and latency

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Cross-domain authentication flow** - Test complete auth flow between domains
- **Session persistence** - Verify sessions survive page refreshes and navigation
- **Failure recovery** - Test auth system recovery from various failure modes
- **Browser compatibility** - Test across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Security testing** - OTP replay attacks, session hijacking attempts
- **Load testing** - Concurrent authentication requests
- **Email delivery testing** - OTP delivery timing and reliability
- **Permission validation** - Role-based access control enforcement
- **Backup auth methods** - Failover authentication paths

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Middleware routing** - Verify all routes properly protected/accessible
- **State synchronization** - Auth state consistency across components
- **Performance testing** - Session validation response times
- **Audit logging** - Verify security events properly logged

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- ✅ TECH-001: Cross-domain session sync (Critical)
- ✅ SEC-001: OTP replay protection (High security)
- ✅ SEC-002: Session security measures (High security)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- BUS-002: Staff access issues (with monitoring and support process)
- OPS-001: Email outages (with extended sessions and monitoring)
- TECH-002/003: Technical issues (with proper error handling)

### Accepted Risks
- PERF-002: Minor latency (< 100ms impact)
- DATA-002: Rare session persistence issues (with re-auth capability)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Authentication success/failure rates** - Track hourly with alerts < 95%
- **OTP delivery times** - Alert if > 30 seconds average
- **Session sync failures** - Real-time alerts for sync errors
- **Security events** - Failed login attempts, privilege escalations
- **Email bounce rates** - Monitor OTP email deliverability

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Moving from single domain to true cross-domain architecture
- Changing authentication providers or methods
- Adding new roles or permission levels
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in dependencies
- Authentication success rate drops below 95%

## Recommendations Summary

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Implement comprehensive error handling for cross-domain session sync
2. Add OTP replay attack protection with expiration and rate limiting
3. Configure secure session management with proper cookie settings
4. Set up authentication monitoring and alerting

### Testing Focus Areas
1. End-to-end cross-domain authentication flows
2. Security testing for common auth vulnerabilities
3. Failure scenario and recovery testing
4. Performance under concurrent login load

### Long-term Improvements
1. Consider WebAuthn/passkeys for enhanced security
2. Implement true single sign-on across domains
3. Add backup OTP delivery methods (SMS, authenticator app)
4. Create admin dashboard for auth system monitoring
