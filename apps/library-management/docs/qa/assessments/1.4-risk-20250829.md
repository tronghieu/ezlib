**Affected Components**: All database queries, Supabase RLS policies, React hooks

**Mitigation**:

- Implement comprehensive RLS policy testing suite
- Add server-side library_id validation layer
- Create cross-library isolation integration tests

- RLS policy validation with multiple scenarios

### 2. SEC-001: Library Access Control Bypass

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High - Multiple validation points increase chance of missing one  
**Impact**: High - Unauthorized users could manage library operations  
**Affected Components**: Authentication middleware, library_staff validation, Context provider

**Mitigation**:

- Multi-layer access validation (client, API, database)
- Implement permission caching with immediate invalidation
- Add comprehensive security test suite
- Create monitoring alerts for access anomalies
- Regular security audits of access patterns

**Testing Focus**:

### 4. TECH-002: Library Context Loss

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: Medium - Can occur during auth refresh  
**Impact**: High - Complete workflow disruption

**Mitigation**:

  - Test data queries with multiple library contexts
  - Verify RLS policies with different user roles
  - Attempt cross-library data access
- **Security Test Suite**
  - Authorization bypass attempts
  - Session manipulation tests
  - Permission escalation scenarios
  - Library access validation edge cases

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Performance Test Suite**
  - Context provider re-render profiling
  - Memory leak detection tests
  - Library switching performance tests
  - 50+ library stress testing
- **State Management Tests**
  - Context persistence across auth changes
  - Library context restoration tests
  - Error recovery scenarios

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

  - Library selector functionality
  - Navigation state consistency
  - localStorage resilience tests
- **Type Safety Tests**

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- ✅ All critical risks (DATA-001, SEC-001) - MANDATORY
- ✅ Memory leak prevention (PERF-001)
- ✅ Basic context loss protection (TECH-002)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- ⚠️ Re-render optimization (TECH-001) - with performance monitoring
- ⚠️ Library switching issues (OPS-001) - with error recovery UI
- ⚠️ localStorage issues (DATA-002) - with fallback mechanisms

### Accepted Risks

- ℹ️ TypeScript type issues (TECH-003) - caught during build

## Monitoring Requirements

### Critical Metrics

- **Security Monitoring**
  - Failed library access attempts
  - Cross-library query attempts
  - Permission validation failures
- **Performance Monitoring**
  - Context provider render counts
  - Memory usage trends
  - Library switching duration
- **Error Monitoring**
  - Context loss frequency
  - localStorage failures
  - RLS policy violations

### Alert Thresholds

- Any cross-library data access attempt → CRITICAL
- Memory usage > 500MB → WARNING
- Library switch > 2 seconds → WARNING
- Context loss rate > 1% → CRITICAL

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update this risk profile when:

- Adding new library-scoped features
- Modifying RLS policies
- Changing authentication flow
- Upgrading React or Supabase versions
- Performance issues reported in production
- Security vulnerabilities discovered

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Implement comprehensive RLS testing** before any deployment
2. **Add security test suite** for authorization scenarios
3. **Profile React Context** implementation for performance
4. **Create monitoring dashboard** for critical metrics

### Development Focus

1. **Code Review Emphasis**: All database queries, RLS policies, Context provider implementation
2. **Additional Validation**: Server-side library_id validation on all operations
3. **Security Controls**: Multi-layer access validation, audit logging

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Phased Rollout**: Deploy to single test library first
2. **Feature Flags**: Enable library switching gradually
3. **Rollback Plan**: Prepared for immediate rollback if data isolation fails
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for security and performance metrics

**Risk Assessment Complete**: This story carries CRITICAL risk due to its foundational multi-tenant nature. Any failure in library context isolation would be catastrophic. Recommend senior developer implementation with extensive security testing.
