# Risk Assessment & Mitigation

## ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk Factors
- **MVP Scope Creep**: Excellent ultra-simple discipline maintained
- **Technical Complexity**: Architecture appropriately scoped for MVP
- **Integration Complexity**: Direct Supabase approach reduces API layer risks
- **Authentication Security**: Leverages proven Supabase Auth patterns

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk Factors (Mitigated)
- **CI/CD Deployment**: Now addressed with comprehensive Story 1.6
- **External Service Integration**: Now addressed with API documentation strategy
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Well-architected but requires careful testing
- **Multi-Tenant Data Isolation**: RLS policies need thorough validation

## Mitigation Strategies Implemented
1. **Deployment Safety**: Health checks, rollback procedures, staging environment
2. **Integration Reliability**: Documented error scenarios, fallback strategies
3. **Real-Time Testing**: Comprehensive test templates for subscription management
4. **Security Validation**: RLS policy testing integrated into acceptance criteria
