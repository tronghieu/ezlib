# EzLib Library Management System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable small/medium libraries (1-3 staff, up to 5K books, 1K members) to replace manual/spreadsheet systems with integrated digital operations
- Reduce administrative overhead for library staff by 40-60% through streamlined workflows
- Achieve 99%+ accuracy in book inventory and member data management
- Provide real-time synchronization with public reader interface for seamless patron experience
- Deliver MVP functionality that proves core value before expanding to advanced features
- Establish foundation for multi-tenant SaaS platform serving resource-constrained libraries

### Background Context

The EzLib Library Management System addresses a critical gap in the small library market, where 70% of facilities operate without integrated digital management systems. These libraries, typically serving up to 5,000 books and 1,000 active members with just 1-3 staff members, currently rely on manual processes and spreadsheet-based tracking that creates operational inefficiencies and data fragmentation.

This administrative web application (accessible at manage.ezlib.com) serves as the operational backbone for library staff, integrating with the broader EzLib ecosystem including the public reader interface and book metadata crawler service. By focusing specifically on small library needs rather than enterprise-scale solutions, the system prioritizes simplicity, affordability, and immediate operational value while leveraging modern web technologies and multi-tenant architecture.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The library management interface prioritizes operational efficiency and staff productivity through clean, intuitive workflows that minimize cognitive load and training time. The design emphasizes rapid task completion for high-frequency operations (check-out/check-in, member lookup, book search) while providing comprehensive functionality for less frequent administrative tasks. The interface should feel familiar to staff comfortable with basic web applications while providing professional reliability and data confidence essential for library operations.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Dashboard-centric Navigation:** Primary dashboard provides at-a-glance operational status and quick access to common tasks
- **Search-first Approach:** Prominent search functionality for both books and members with intelligent autocomplete and filtering
- **Modal-based Workflows:** Complex operations (new member registration, book cataloging) use focused modal dialogs to maintain context
- **Contextual Actions:** Action buttons and menus appear contextually based on current selection and user permissions
- **Keyboard-friendly Operations:** Support for keyboard shortcuts and tab navigation for power users performing repetitive tasks
- **Real-time Status Updates:** Live indicators for book availability, member status, and system sync status

### Core Screens and Views
- **Main Dashboard:** Operational overview with quick stats, recent activity, and shortcuts to common tasks
- **Book Management:** Comprehensive book inventory with search, filtering, and bulk operations
- **Member Directory:** Complete member database with search, profiles, and borrowing history
- **Circulation Desk:** Dedicated check-out/check-in interface optimized for desk operations
- **Reports Center:** Standard and custom reports with filtering and export capabilities
- **Overdue Management:** Dedicated view for tracking and managing overdue items and communications
- **System Settings:** Library configuration, policies, user management, and integration settings
- **Audit Log:** Read-only system activity tracking for compliance and troubleshooting

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The interface will meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards including proper keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, sufficient color contrast, and alternative text for all visual elements. This ensures usability for staff members with varying abilities and supports libraries' commitment to inclusive service.

### Branding
The interface will integrate with the broader EzLib design system while maintaining professional library aesthetics. Clean, modern styling with emphasis on readability and data clarity. Color palette will use calming, professional tones (blues, grays) with clear status indicators (green for available, red for overdue, amber for warnings). Typography will prioritize legibility for extended screen usage.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary target is desktop browsers (1024px+) with tablet responsiveness for circulation desk flexibility. The interface will be optimized for:
- **Desktop:** Full-featured interface with multi-column layouts and comprehensive data displays
- **Tablet (landscape):** Simplified layouts suitable for circulation desk operations and mobile inventory management
- **Modern browsers:** Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+ with progressive enhancement

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
The library management application will be developed within the existing EzLib monorepo structure as `apps/library-management/`. This follows the established pattern alongside `apps/reader/` and `services/crawler/`, enabling shared configurations, dependencies, and streamlined deployment while maintaining clear application boundaries.

### Service Architecture
**Direct Supabase Integration Architecture:** The application will connect directly to the shared Supabase PostgreSQL database without an intermediate API layer, following EzLib's architectural principle of direct client connections. This Jamstack approach provides:
- Real-time subscriptions for live data updates
- Built-in Row Level Security for multi-tenant isolation
- Reduced complexity and latency compared to custom API layers
- Seamless integration with existing database schema and RLS policies

### Testing Requirements
**Comprehensive Testing Strategy:** Implementation will include unit testing, integration testing with Supabase, and end-to-end user workflow testing:
- **Unit Tests:** Component logic, utility functions, and business rule validation
- **Integration Tests:** Database operations, real-time subscriptions, and crawler service integration

### UX Expert Prompt

The PRD is complete and ready for UI/UX specification development. Please create a comprehensive front-end specification using the `front-end-spec-tmpl` template, focusing on the dashboard-centric, search-first interface paradigms outlined in the UI Design Goals section. Pay special attention to the circulation desk workflows and multi-tenant library context switching requirements.

### Architect Prompt

The PRD provides detailed technical assumptions and system requirements. Please create the frontend architecture document using the `front-end-architecture-tmpl` template, ensuring seamless integration with the existing EzLib monorepo structure, Supabase direct connections, and real-time synchronization requirements. Consider the multi-tenant authentication patterns and performance requirements for libraries managing up to 5,000 books and 1,000 members.
