# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication

**Expanded Goal:** Establish secure, scalable project foundation with user authentication, database schema, and core infrastructure that differentiates library staff from readers. This epic delivers a deployable authentication system and prepares the technical foundation for all library operations and reader interactions.

### Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

As a **developer**,
I want to establish the basic Next.js project structure with essential dependencies and configuration,
so that the development environment is ready for building EzLib features.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Next.js 14+ project created with TypeScript configuration
2. Tailwind CSS integrated and configured for styling
3. ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality
4. Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore
5. Package.json configured with all necessary dependencies (Supabase client, Zod, etc.)
6. Development scripts configured (dev, build, lint, test)
7. Basic project structure established (pages, components, lib, types directories)
8. Environment variables template created for Supabase configuration

### Story 1.2: Supabase Database Schema and Connection

As a **developer**,
I want to establish the database schema and Supabase connection,
so that the application can store and retrieve books, members, and borrowing data.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Supabase project created and configured
2. Database schema implemented with tables: libraries, books, members, borrowing_transactions
3. Row Level Security (RLS) policies configured for data protection
4. Supabase client configured in Next.js application
5. Database connection tested with basic health check
6. Migration scripts created for schema versioning
7. Seed data script created for development/testing purposes
8. Database types generated for TypeScript integration

### Story 1.3: User Authentication System

As a **library staff member** and **reader**,
I want to create accounts and login securely,
so that I can access appropriate features based on my role.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Supabase Auth integrated with email/password authentication
2. User registration flow implemented for both staff and readers
3. Login/logout functionality working correctly
4. User profiles table linked to auth.users
5. Role-based access control implemented (library_staff vs reader roles)
6. Protected routes middleware configured
7. Authentication state management implemented with React Context
8. Password reset functionality available
9. User session persistence across browser sessions

### Story 1.4: Library Registration and Management

As a **library administrator**,
I want to register my library and manage library-specific settings,
so that my staff can begin using the system for our collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Library registration form implemented with basic information fields
2. Library profiles stored in database with unique identifiers
3. Library staff can be associated with specific libraries
4. Library settings page created for basic configuration
5. Library selection functionality for staff with multi-library access
6. Library profile validation and error handling
7. Initial library dashboard created showing library information
8. Library deletion/deactivation functionality for administrators
