# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

Please review this PRD and create the front-end specification focusing on the dual-interface design (library staff operations vs reader browsing). Pay special attention to the mobile-responsive reader experience and professional desktop workflows for library staff.

## Architect Prompt

Please review this PRD and create the fullstack architecture specification. Focus on the monorepo Next.js + Supabase approach with particular attention to role-based access control, real-time book availability updates, and scalable data architecture for multi-library deployment.
