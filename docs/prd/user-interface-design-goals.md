# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

EzLib prioritizes simplicity and efficiency for two distinct user types: library staff performing operational tasks and readers browsing/requesting books. The interface emphasizes clear, task-focused workflows with minimal clicks and intuitive navigation. Library staff side focuses on professional, functional design that reduces administrative overhead, while reader side provides a clean, browsable book discovery experience similar to familiar e-commerce patterns.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **One-Click Operations:** Check out, check in, and borrow request actions require single click/tap
- **List-Based Views:** Books and members displayed in scannable list formats with key information visible
- **Search-First Navigation:** Quick search functionality for finding books and members without complex categorization
- **Status-Driven Design:** Clear visual indicators for book availability, member status, and system state
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Show essential information first, detailed views on demand

### Core Screens and Views

- **Library Staff Dashboard:** Central hub showing recent activity, pending requests, and quick access to key functions
- **Book Management Screen:** Add, edit, and view book collection with availability status
- **Member Management Screen:** View, search, and manage library member profiles
- **Checkout/Checkin Interface:** Streamlined workflow for processing book transactions
- **Reader Book Browser:** Public-facing catalog of available books with borrowing request functionality
- **Request Management Screen:** Library staff interface for approving/declining borrowing requests

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Ensure keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and sufficient color contrast for professional library environments and diverse user populations.

### Branding

Clean, professional aesthetic appropriate for institutional use. Neutral color palette with clear visual hierarchy. Avoid overly casual or consumer-focused design patterns that might undermine professional credibility with library stakeholders.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Web-first responsive design serving both desktop library workstations and mobile reader access. Prioritize desktop usability for library staff workflows while ensuring mobile reader experience remains functional and pleasant.
