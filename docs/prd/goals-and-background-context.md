# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable readers to browse and borrow books from local libraries through a simple digital interface
- Provide small/medium libraries with basic operational management tools for books, members, and borrowing
- Validate core book borrowing behavior before building advanced social discovery features
- Replace manual/spreadsheet-based library tracking with simple digital checkout system
- Create operational efficiency gains for resource-constrained libraries with 1-3 staff members

### Background Context

EzLib addresses the critical operational gap in small and medium libraries that lack integrated management systems, while simultaneously providing readers with digital access to local library collections. The platform focuses on the underserved community library market (70% operate without digital management systems) and validates core book borrowing workflows before expanding to social discovery features.

The minimalist MVP approach prioritizes immediate operational value for libraries - simple book listing, member tracking, and checkout/return workflows - while testing reader engagement with digital library browsing. This foundation enables future expansion into social book discovery and cross-library integration once core behaviors are validated.
