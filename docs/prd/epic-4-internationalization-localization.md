# Epic 4: Internationalization & Localization

**Expanded Goal:** Enable EzLib to serve libraries and readers across different countries and language preferences through comprehensive internationalization support. Implement automatic location-based language detection during registration with user-configurable preferences, ensuring culturally appropriate interfaces for both library staff operations and reader experiences.

## Story 4.1: i18n Infrastructure and Configuration

As a **developer**,
I want to establish the internationalization infrastructure and configuration,
so that the application can support multiple languages and locales efficiently.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Next.js i18n configuration implemented with locale routing
2. React-intl integration for message formatting and translation management
3. Translation key extraction and management system established
4. Locale detection middleware configured for automatic language selection
5. ICU message format support for pluralization and number formatting
6. Development workflow established for adding new translations
7. Translation file structure organized by feature/page for maintainability
8. Fallback language configuration (English) for missing translations

## Story 4.2: User Location Detection and Country Selection

As a **reader** and **library staff member**,
I want the system to automatically detect my location and allow me to select my country preference,
so that I receive appropriate language and cultural formatting for my region.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. IP-based geolocation service integrated for automatic country detection
2. Country selection interface available during user registration
3. Location detection runs automatically on first visit with user consent
4. Manual country selection override available in user profile settings
5. Country preference stored in user profile and persists across sessions
6. Geographic location API fallback handling for when detection fails
7. GDPR-compliant location detection with proper user consent
8. Country selection affects both language and regional formatting preferences

## Story 4.3: Core Interface Translation (English/Spanish)

As a **library staff member** and **reader**,
I want to use the system in my preferred language,
so that I can efficiently perform tasks without language barriers.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. All user-facing text translated for English and Spanish languages
2. Library staff interface fully localized (dashboard, forms, buttons, messages)
3. Reader interface fully localized (book browser, requests, profile)
4. Dynamic language switching without page reload
5. Language selection persists across user sessions
6. Error messages and validation text translated appropriately
7. Help text and tooltips available in both languages
8. Email notifications sent in user's preferred language

## Story 4.4: Cultural and Regional Formatting

As a **user in different countries**,
I want dates, numbers, and cultural conventions to display in my familiar format,
so that the system feels natural and professional in my regional context.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Date formatting matches user's country conventions (MM/DD/YYYY vs DD/MM/YYYY vs YYYY-MM-DD)
2. Number formatting includes appropriate thousands separators and decimal points
3. Time formatting displays in 12-hour or 24-hour format based on regional preference
4. Currency display (if applicable) uses appropriate symbols and formatting
5. Address formatting matches country conventions for library addresses
6. Phone number formatting and validation matches country-specific patterns
7. Postal code validation adapts to country-specific formats
8. Right-to-left (RTL) language architecture prepared for future Arabic/Hebrew support

## Story 4.5: Admin Language Management Interface

As a **system administrator**,
I want to manage translations and language settings,
so that I can maintain accurate localization and add new language support.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Translation management interface for administrators
2. Missing translation detection and reporting
3. Translation key usage analytics to identify unused strings
4. Bulk translation import/export functionality (JSON/CSV formats)
5. Translation approval workflow for community contributors
6. Language pack version management and deployment
7. Translation quality metrics and user feedback collection
8. Automated testing for translation completeness across all supported languages
